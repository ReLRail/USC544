the blue side they won a coin toss yesterday they will remove leblanc and desire ahri and lucian taken away by t1
0:06
something we saw a lot of yesterday from tier 1 was this priority on desire we saw g2 drafting a lot of dive
0:12
compositions that were trying force engages forced team fights and desire pick was something that t1 was
0:17
happy to uh pick for gumayushi and gave him a lot of safety or also a lot of agency in lane by removing the renate as
0:24
well orange is heavily suggesting they're looking at something along the lines of a galio comp once again i was so interested to see if we were gonna
0:30
get the first pick when because both these guys are comfortable to play gp into gwen or gwen into gp bin especially
0:36
is also very happy to bring out things like the jacks as an additional answer and i think a lot of this series may
0:42
pivot on this top lane matchup because gwen has been such a high performing champion at msi it has been by far the
0:48
most played of the top laners and has been absolutely dominating so if you can come out of the gate with a strong
0:54
answer to it and it's going to be jace as that answer so zeus can actually win this matchup they can really shift
0:59
priorities and start to change what pikmin looks like a very volatile top lane matchup for sure i expect to see
1:05
junglers making their way towards that side of the map or one of the big champions that we've been seeing rise in popularity as the tournament has gone on
1:12
has been this knock down knockdown paired alongside things like the galileo have been very common knock down
1:17
alongside twisted fate the ability to attack side lanes the ability to find picks uh and kind of work together with
1:23
your mid laner is a very effective dive comp execution that many teams are very find a lot of success with and a big
1:30
thing for t1 as well is they haven't played either of these champions for a long time no knock turns so far in the tournament for owners they have played
1:36
jace once in the group stage versus red knights i think so t1 bringing a lot of new things to this draft already what
1:42
you'll notice here is that they can lock in the galio because if they go for the twisted uh the tristana then they're
1:48
going to be full lady they've already got the jason they've already got the knock turns rng very quickly realizing ah we see our window you're not gonna
1:54
bring that tristana out like you did yesterday and it'll be interesting i mean do they go for it anyway you still could try to look for it instead it's
1:59
actually gonna be azir something we haven't really been seeing whatsoever at the tournament uh but some powerful disengage there the ability to actually
2:06
sweep back what is three melee champions that have already been drafted here by rng and vigo's such an interesting one
2:11
to me because viego has been struggling at msi but not for these two junglers in in particular you know it's 11 and 26 at
2:18
msi overall but whey is four and one on the pick and without way and owner this champion is like a 15 win rate and
2:25
already as you say the viega obviously a very interesting pick but t1 these three picks are so surprising to me not
2:30
because i don't think these guys can play the champions but as i said zeus has one jace game owner has no knock-down games at msi and faker has no
2:37
azir games we haven't seen azir the entire tournament t1 obviously well prepared for today well one thing i will
2:43
say is that often when you think of certain players you think of certain champions and faker with his very long
2:48
tenure does have quite a few champions to his name azir is one of them uh it is a champion that he can often default to
2:55
often rely on when the chips are down and it's something that he has very uh consistent success on the question is
3:01
does it make sense in this composition you've got a nocturn that wants to dive into the back line you've got to chase those to leverage the poke you've got
3:06
azir who is both disengaged does have long range poke also good scaling right now tion's composition is a little bit
3:13
all over the place whereas rng has a very dedicated and clear-cut plan and we'll see if they can actually have some picks here to pull it all together right
3:19
because i agree with you sometimes you can kind of get trapped when you're looking for a denial pick you're saying okay if they want to go galio we don't
3:24
want them to have the nocturne but if you allow if you allow that to really kind of disrupt what you're trying to
3:30
build with your own 5e5 that can sometimes be problematic you can destroy your own composition with that so we'll
3:35
see if they can have some picks to pull together if i'm counting this correctly that is 680 carry bands that have been
3:40
removed from the pool which is going to be super interesting we're going to be going very deep felios is things that
3:45
we're looking at right now oh the caitlyn was fabled coming into the tournament it
3:52
was something that i was speaking with cadrell about extensively uh and in the lck this is like pick man this is a
3:58
champion that you could not afford to give t1 and now they're finally gonna be bringing it out range it's very clearly
4:04
the identity of tywon's composition six games six wins for goomba actually on the caitlyn this year and yeah and
4:09
generally when we see caitlyn we see it paired with ranged supports right so now rng have to decide what do they actually
4:16
want to go to yes there are some things like the aphallos but the laning phase is definitely weaker it can actually i think suffer into things like that
4:22
caitlyn lux potentially if you want to go for something like tristana that really would suffer so i think your options become more limited because t1
4:29
has heavily focused uh ads in the pick ban rng did as well and potentially with last pick support t1 is going for that
4:36
2v2 dominance you know they have been incredibly strong and when you think of how rng has had success not just here
4:41
but also regionally in the lpl it was largely through gala's team fighting you know when they would fall behind against
4:47
top it could always rely on gala to crush in team fights and can you rely on that with the
4:53
tristana pick here early against caitlyn and we're going to find out if it's going to be karma or lux i'm expecting
4:58
it to be an aggressive pick and really just try to slam it home and this is a brave thing to do for t1 because gummy usually has not had the tournament of
5:05
his life like a lot of people saying he played better in the lck than he has been playing at msi gala and ming on the
5:10
other hand having a very strong tournament especially around those team fights i will say though goomba i think has really stepped it up another option
5:16
is morgana which would be really old school but into november and i think it actually fits so well i'm glad i got the time to actually jump in
5:22
there and say it because this to me is the throwback but this makes so much sense in the draft because i was looking
5:27
across you know galio taunts the nautilus ultimate is so easy to actually land a successful black shield on and
5:34
this is going to be really really exciting because we just never see it anymore it's almost always caitlyn lux caitlyn karma morgana can be very very
5:42
hit or miss but this is an extremely dominant lane 2v2 you want to have owner playing around that bot side trying to
5:48
protect them wei and xiao who you already know are going to be trying to get down there get gala going uh because
5:54
in an isolated 2v2 you can expect t1 to blast them i'm just excited that we are
5:59
getting a very expected clash of styles rng throughout
6:04
the lpl was not known for their early game dominance but their mid to late game i mean we've demonstrated it throughout the tournament how
6:10
intelligent they play the map how efficient they can be in terms of maximizing their farm controlling vision
6:17
and playing around objectives you contrast that to t1 who are the early game monsters they average ridiculous
6:24
early game gold leads and they will decimate you in lane and will snowball the game to victory the big question for
6:31
today is which star will come out on top which one will be able to secure the msi
6:37
title and already in game one we have both teams with their identities on full display ready to secure game one and
6:44
it's not just a battle for the pride of the individual teams t1 of course looking for their third msi title rng
6:50
trying to do the same it is a battle for the pride of your region lck have been down in the dirt for the last four years
6:56
only dom one have been able to dominate against china and that lpl consistent of
7:02
victory after consistent of victory may end today t1 versus rng game one of msi
7:09
2022 finals let's get on to the rift
7:14
and starting things off i'm just so curious to see how owner is going to be able to perform on this nocturne because
7:19
they didn't have any additional dive picks to actually kind of be a dive buddy with him like sure morgana theoretically can kind of like flash in
7:25
there but generally speaking for support you're not really going to do that unless you're like
7:39
though you're drafting for 2v2 dominator drafting to smash gala here in this 2v2
7:45
and tristana starts with first blood he's even going to get the base off he's starting double long sword and four bots
7:51
how are you going to push him out of lane this is exactly what rng did against eg they did it on the top side
7:57
predator rng with a strong level one they were able to take advantage of the predator galio they were able to punish
8:03
kumiyushi he didn't want to commit any of the summoners and i think it was wise because rng they
8:08
know how to punish that i think when we look back to their eg series the moment the impact lost his flash what did they
8:14
do they dived him at level four they dived him at level six and they know exactly how to punish so uh while he
8:20
does hold on to his summoners we'll see how much it affects the life well and i'm really curious did he actually skill eat right did he's trying to skill e and
8:25
like try to get to the wall and jump over i wonder if that's why he was actually holding on to the flash because if that's the case that can really hurt
8:32
he did skill q so he didn't actually do it so yeah he just held on to it they're gonna be playing for lame but it's gonna be a lot more difficult tris you know
8:39
with double long swords and the additional potions here still you know carry it can help with the shove and we'll see how effective they can be if
8:45
you can land the binding it's easy to follow it up with the trap that's the kind of combination you're looking for it's such a long amount of cc and gala
8:52
as a result is gonna have to play cleanse and as we already talked about coming into this matchup expectations were that t1 would have that early game
8:58
lead when we look at their averages throughout the tournament uh t1 typically dominate in the early game we
9:04
see them having ridiculous goal leads you can see 85 percent of first heralds
9:09
100 percent of first house they averaged 4.5 kills at 14 minutes and the average the average a
9:17
3.5 k gold lead it is ridiculous and rng is already going toe to toe we're looking for faker in the mid lane
9:22
towards going to come out here faker able to get underneath this tower should be safe just a bit of chip damage down onto the bird in the mid lane
9:28
the reason why i wanted to bring attention to tijuan's early game dominance was because this is actually a style that rng is very used to
9:35
domestically top esports was a team that would be high progressive in the early game look for early got uh advantages
9:40
yet rng was actually able to weather the storm yeah absolutely right and largely it was about their team fighting and as
9:45
we said it was about gala in the later stages playing around him him having success you know in that 5v5 stage later
9:52
on uh ming able to clear out the trap that goomba did put down there that was a really late rock jump i think he was
9:58
trying to buffer it maybe he was expecting he might get hit so buffering the rocket jump but early on in the game it's a very long cooldown so we'll see
10:04
if they uh can look to punish that whatsoever carrier also is playing comet and ignite so again very lane focused
10:10
here at 4t1 so it is problematic if they can't get an advantage you really do want to try to chip out the tris push
10:16
them in and then harass them under tower and start farming plates because when you're playing these these double range lanes with caitlyn it's not just about
10:22
the 2v2 it's about winning the 2v2 then getting out on the map and being able to farm plates across the map you have to
10:28
play from ahead against something like the tristana joe who stopped her in his justice punch fake able to slide forward
10:33
put some damage down in the mid lane there's looking for some damage on the bin in the top they're not gonna be able to get too much more and as you say that
10:39
it wasn't just the fact that gala got gold out of the first kills the fact that he was able to get all of these pots because although
10:44
gummy you see and carry i have the pushing lane they have the pressure in this lane garlic can just stand back except that he's going to be 10 15 20 cs
10:50
down but not lose too much because he's always able to be stopped uh topped up and helped the credit to them though they've had the push right they've
10:56
already gotten their first play here four minutes in so that is really really good you know owner was shadowing them to make sure that they could get the
11:02
crash and now i'm gonna be out on the map farming early lucidity boots i always love on noctur and you hit six
11:08
you sometimes just take the second blue buff and then you have lucidity boots you have the extra cdr you use that first halt if you can get a kill there
11:14
rinse and repeat back to farming every time multi's up you look to be proactive uh so it's gonna be more pressure i feel
11:20
like on way to try to disrupt that pattern and try to force them to fight more often than they want and this is
11:25
something we actually saw t1 do incredibly well against g2 yesterday when g2 picked nocturne it was just
11:31
owner you know on the other side of the matchup constantly forcing fights where jankos was forced to respond but he
11:36
didn't really want to he wants to be waiting for the ultimate he wants you playing around that cooldown so i'm interested to see if we can do the same thing to him
11:43
a few options for owner in the early game only level four right now as you say just farming up towards that level six on his way towards his wolf camp
11:49
first reset comes out of gumiyushi and carrier they'll get the noon quiver and a bit of extra ap for carrier the boot
11:55
obviously does help for carry if he wants to roam around the map it's not something we've seen him do too often sometimes he will go towards the mid
12:01
lane but often he just likes to stay down in the bottom lane especially when you have a pushing lane like this consistently looking for opportunities
12:07
to roam moving into the river a very powerful tool for a mid laner is the fog of war uh
12:13
we often like to talk about how roaming can generate a lot of pressure but by just moving into fog you immediately have to oh he could be
12:19
coming top he could be coming bot and jiahu uh demonstrating that pressure and t1 having to respect well look at how
12:24
much vision they have in the top side river you know rng have covered that uh with multiple pink wards they have the
12:30
the scuttle they have another ward as well over on raptors that is to threaten that move from xiaohu up towards top
12:36
side and that is kind of hinting that that is the side of the map that they are looking to play towards machahu predator popped here a lucidity boot
12:43
rush for him as well uh but of course it is spotted out by that pink ward so kerry and gumushi able to play this safe
12:48
still every time that they can get that little relief of pressure it's gonna be a good thing here for gala and ming and
12:54
i i do want to bring up as well yesterday when we saw t1 play against the galio we saw camps
13:00
being heavily punished in the laning phase a large part of that was because of the tristana that he was playing into but also he was kind of forced to play
13:06
off the timings of his bot lane whereas now we're actually seeing rng play to the timings of xiaohu uh he will push
13:12
out the wave when he sees an opportunity and then way will group up with him and then they'll look to control vision and
13:17
azeal your highlighting in our observers are showcasing it for us now look how dark the map is right now in contrast to
13:22
the amount of control rng have and again i want to bring us back to that final versus top esports the ways in which
13:27
they would mitigate that pressure try and weather that storm of early aggression was by utilizing map control
13:33
good vision and just doing what they could to prevent a dominant early game team from snowballing and dominating the
13:39
floor sun's gonna land there's the hook follow up no dark shoot in time for carrier second kill of the game over the gala kumi usually able to retreat nicely
13:47
done way with so much patience there they get the kill and perfect follow-up from ming flashing in
13:52
there's actually zero wards one ward now placed on the map by t1 that pink that just got dropped by owner top side they
13:58
literally had no warts on the entire map which was pretty shocking to see you know multiple sweepers the trinkets were
14:03
all in cooldowns no one had a pink down so didn't have any tracking on way and he just had the patience there finds a
14:10
kill and now they're going to be relieving that pressure again getting a good reset here for gala and thankfully
14:16
for rng he again comes away with a kill that's exactly where he wanted excellent early game control from rng and just a
14:22
really good window of opportunity there recognizing that the wave state was in a good spot where he could sneak in and uh
14:28
way is a player that i think when we also think holistically is a very young player right when we think about the
14:33
average age obviously we talk a lot about how young the talent is but you also look at the number of
14:38
international games it is very few of course xiaohu and ming dwarf in terms of international games but wait actually
14:44
only starting uh very recently for the actual lineup of rng yeah he only started with them you know at the start
14:49
of 2021 been coming in at the start of 2022. gala has only been there since summer 2020 you know the three young
14:57
players are on rng have not been around for that long you know it's 19 19 and 21
15:02
uh for gala so it's it's a lot of young talent between these two organizations yeah you just have to look at t1 side as well no one
15:08
but faker was playing professionally when faker won last one an international title right
15:13
like all of these guys started in 2018 or later you saw very young players and we'll have to see how they're able
15:20
to match up into rng you've had a strong early game start absolutely and i think it really speaks to the scouting you
15:25
know from these teams right t1 everyone except for carrier came up through the t1 organization you know through their academy teams and kind of scouting teams
15:32
amateur teams um and have been you know such incredible talents for this for this roster you know so many young
15:39
players on the t1 side you know it's kind of the grandpa and the four kids here faker and the rest of the squad it's the boomer and the zoomers so the
15:45
teenage mutant ninja turtles there you go guys master splinter in the mid lane um but i mean they're just playing it so
15:52
mechanically impressively across this whole year that you know faker showcased yesterday that he can dominate sometimes
15:58
in the 1v1 but he doesn't always have to he often does play more of a facilitating role because his side lanes are so commonly ahead are so commonly
16:04
winning uh he isn't forced to take risks
16:10
for the moment he hasn't actually been forced to move out of his lane too much either 20 cs up over on this gallow of course t1 had this pressure in the
16:16
bottom lane and we thought from the draft they were likely to play around it rng have matched that well way has been in the right position obviously first
16:22
blood help with that but t1 still at the 10-minute mark about a thousand gold ahead it's sort of what we would expect
16:28
because when we talked about it to one of drafted three winning lanes they're pushing top pushing mid and pushing bar
16:34
and you can see that cs discrepancy really starting to build across all three lanes on top of that t1 have two
16:40
plates in the top lane they have one plate in mid lane they have three plates in bot lane they are leveraging their early strength in order to secure these
16:46
plates and sure they aren't finding these kills but at the end of the day their composition is doing what it is
16:51
designed to do which is win lane and rng are just doing their best as we've repeatedly discussed to try and weather
16:57
that storm mitigate that pressure and limit tijuan's impact in the early game and my big question on if t1 can begin
17:03
to snowball that is how effective is the first nocturn ultimate going to be right he has three pieces of cdr so he actually has been able to purchase that
17:08
up before having to use his first alt which always does feel really nice caulfield's kindle gem as well as the cdr boots but he is level seven he wants
17:16
to get out there on the map try to get active if you can get that first kill start to convert you know some of these
17:21
early tower plates uh that you've gotten into something more into a full first hour and you can really extend that
17:27
advantage because i don't think that nocturne wants to play from parity here you know he doesn't have a dive buddy you have to be more active in the early
17:33
stages because i do think that the job in the 5v5 is going to be really difficult for owner
17:38
i don't know if you're going to be able to get on a back line winchester can just jump away when you have a galio in front of you and you have been just
17:44
wrecking through your back line we did see ace in the hole used by kumushi just for some harass down towards that bottom side ming has left gala alone for a
17:49
while as rng trying to set up around this first dragon they made a few forays into the t1 jungle got a bit of vision
17:55
down you can see once again t1 with three wards on the map two in the bot lane bushes one in the top lane i don't
18:00
think they're gonna contest this dragon as rng will take it and rng is one of the only teams that has really been
18:06
prioritizing dragons you know at this event you know it has been a much more fast-paced event you know the average
18:11
game time 29-16 so very few teams are even getting to seoul uh but rng you know throughout the rumble stage was had
18:18
a 70 first dragon rate you know t1 only 40 they're focusing much more on harold in general but this game rng able to get
18:25
both herald and that first dragon so gonna be feeling really good about that is the gold gap
18:30
it is closing significantly and i do favor rng's comp quite a bit uh from even states and i'm looking at the gold
18:37
right now you can see that gala is in fact ahead of his lane counterpart even with the cs discrepancy by and large
18:42
thanks to the two kills on the plates rng leveraging this fog of war we already talked about xiaohu and how he
18:47
utilizes it now the rng bot side of the map doing the same thing good flash away from kyrie ming tried to
18:53
find a flash hook up flashes himself could have gone for the black shield but of course then the nautilus will chase you and he can look for kumiyushi with a
19:00
depth charge and again i want to bring your attention to the minimap notice this control the rng have they see the
19:05
knockdown is hovering around they have this wall they have this one they also have these two control boards in the top river it's just complete river dominance
19:11
from the side of rng and they're just keeping an eye on what nocturne is doing you talked about it as l how impactful will that first knock down ultimate be
19:18
rng is not giving him a chance to use it absolutely i mean they're just crushing in the vision game right now you know t1
19:23
is getting choked out as far as that goes they're not really having uh many eyes on this then just using his all
19:28
really to clear out the wave as zeus was threatening the dive and chipping this down he does have tp so he's just going to use the all clear out the wave base
19:35
come back and yes ben is getting pressured but i have to say he's done a very good job of keeping the farm even
19:40
and this matchup especially when gwen goes ghost gets really scary later on for jace because in these extended lanes
19:47
especially once you get towards riftmaker uh there is the potential to get chased down and it's partly the knock-on effect of knowing where owner
19:53
is reasonable position themselves by having a gold lead it's just a matter of can they execute this composition
19:59
against what rng have drafted and into the style that rng typically likes to play and obviously as t1 starts to take these
20:06
tier one towers it does open up the map more for them knocked him very good at getting into a side lane very quickly
20:12
bolstering his teammates and trying to get those 2v1 plays in that top or bottom lane and i want to very quickly
20:18
once again draw your attention to the mini map look at these supports their own timings will be spotted out but kerry are doing
20:24
the exact same thing this vision war is really going to be decided by two of the best supports i mean this is huge though
20:29
because faker has tp and they know whey and ning are in this bush they know exactly where they are kerry
20:34
is here owners here faker can tp in it's a very good wars faker
20:41
he's in a position to tp right now he's just making his way back towards the mid lane rng this trap they don't know that they
20:47
are the ones yeah they have unleashed tp right now i think that's maybe what they were waiting for because the tp ward is
20:53
actually now available just across yeah they're gonna go depth charge comes out there's the black shield as well the hook goes wide owner coming in with the
20:59
ottoman as well there's the tp by baker t one they laid debate they set the trap and rng walked unsuspecting into the
21:06
gaping wall of t1 show who hit to join double twelve they get able to dodge to the side of it way very low doesn't want the resets he's gonna be able to get one
21:13
zeos on the back line forced out by bin he will fall as well kamiyushi now joins the fray it is a two for two in the top
21:19
lane this is really good for rng though because gala is alone in the bottom lane he could potentially take this first tower right now this would be the first
21:26
time they had lost first tower we'll see if he can even win the race he lost his minions so it's gonna be really close between them but it looks like t1 will
21:32
still actually get it and maintain the 100 first power rate just barely but i love
21:38
the setup from t1 recognizing not only that they could actually lay this rap but waiting until it was post 14 minutes
21:44
so faker could join not from the tower but from the lane ward it was really really intelligent very well
21:50
orchestrated but rng able to fight their way out of it xiaohu getting up there with the lt
21:56
bin's alt came off cooldown barely at the end so he could win out against as well and i think what's uh great for t1
22:02
in that situation too is that they didn't have to commit uh it was very situational based on whether or not rng
22:08
chose to try and spring that trap which they did they committed to try and killing zeus zeus rather and then the
22:13
moment that they did that was when tijuan responded they had caitlyn coming down in lane and we we highlighted the
22:18
ward didn't actually catch it there the positioning
22:23
doing everything right
22:36
so faker he's just catching this midway not giving anything away that the engage comes through the moment the rng over step in the lane and the
22:42
ultimate comes through that's when the tp strikes yeah but ben was such a problem here you know even though he didn't start the fight with the ulti was
22:48
able to really buy a lot of time there now that's the tp flank here coming in from xiaohu remembers tier
22:54
has no tower here to defend him this should be an easy enough kill for the rng top lane in mid lane now there's the taunt no flash coming out from zach
23:00
he'll save that one for another day bin with his second kill of the game they hand that one over to pin and t1 is
23:06
gonna cross map it on the top side of the map with the herald so good use of the tp from xiaohu
23:11
in order to punish uh the the well i guess the powerless zeus in that position his team was on the top side of
23:18
the map he ends up getting caught and it's going to be hard now because bin actually just got back to back hills right he is gonna be going you know more
23:25
for the the split push build he's got his first dagger gonna be working towards that nasher so uh you know will be looking really strong in the 1v1 and
23:32
xiaohu is going to continue playing towards him rng have been great with the vision so if they can continue maintaining vision control in the sides
23:39
allow them to push this up they've already grabbed their second dragon it's gonna be ocean soul which is so deadly
23:44
on someone like a gwen in a 1v1 against a jace you have to kind of poke down this champion before you can threaten any sort of all-in oh faker look for the
23:51
slide with a dash away by ben he's having a game of his life right now has been a little bit disappointing at times
23:57
during ms isaiah's probably the best top laner in the tournament but here bin is really showing up on the final stage he
24:02
certainly is it takes me back to his performance on suning when they made that run towards the world finals where
24:09
they were stopped by darmon i still remember those barrels yes i mean you should also remember his
24:14
fiora where he actually got a pentakill in the world finals as well and i believe that was the first pence we've ever had in a finals two like he seems
24:21
to really step up when the games matter and i also think back to his lpl finals where he also had a very solid performance and so yes his inconsistency
24:28
is something that has been criticized about him in a potential weak point but uh when when it matters he seems to
24:34
definitely step up and i would say most of his inconsistent games at msi were in the first couple games right you know he had some more risky games uh where he
24:40
was kind of playing you know the ignite gwen style died a couple times he had obviously the camille game that a lot of people were criticizing but even an
24:46
interview right after that where he wanted to play more conservative wanted to play for the team make sure he wasn't getting any sort of a disadvantage and
24:52
every game he's played gwen after that interview he played exhaust or he played ghost right he has played more respectful to his opponents he hasn't
24:58
always just been flipping the lane in low health situations and he's trusting that hey we are going to find these guaranteed kills we are going to find
25:04
these perfect setups and so far it has been working for them in this one of course ghost scales so well when it comes to later game yeah side laning
25:11
because you can just chase down zeus and you can ghost in xiao who can come in with the ultimate as well it becomes very hard for zeus to actually win out
25:18
that 1v1 in the sideline now of course we do talk a lot about how we do favor rng's comp the later this game goes and
25:24
the one caveat to that is fakers azir uh that sucks at least it wasn't a
25:30
stopwatch yeah that still sucks yeah i'm very unfortunate there uh not i wonder if that was the classic
25:36
normally normally i have my wards on this button i think so then i didn't realize that when i completed the item they swapped

to get the better of someday in their previous series and someday yesterday bringing out things like the gwen like
0:06
the fiora and taking advantage of that in their series and one of the biggest ones that he was able to use for fudge
0:11
was the cannon kennen buffed on this patch and not that many top laners have actually really indexed heavily into
0:18
that champion and hundred thieves in their previous matchup had to end up banning it every single game after they
0:24
lost to it well cloud9 i love this fudge hovering what he started the season on soraka and
0:30
ivorn as a mid laner a bit of a floundering split but they switched it up he is back on top a top dog for sure
0:38
berserker still in zven on the support and it's like hey it's about the bot lane it's a bot lane meta it's zerry
0:45
zerry picked up for berserker so much on his shoulders for cloud nine but if this hover goes through for abu dhabi with
0:52
the azir lock in did you already start to think about the counters from jensen the silas the akali as well following
0:58
that up before you go to the next round of fans i wonder if hunter thieves will actually go towards lulu or if they're even having that high prior on it
1:04
because undefeated yesterday were okay to actually forego some of the enchanters and play engage from bot lane but i mean you could take sivir on three
1:10
and grab lulu here tonight denying a new channel from zarya plus with with the changes in the meta we've seen soraka
1:16
start to emerge them reach to other enchanters and healing uh supports in the bottom lane as well that's what
1:21
champion pools are for there's more than just the zary uh versus you know with the lulu or just with the um you got a
1:27
lot of options out there and i love that who he's had a gigantic pool so far this split sven's played all manner of
1:32
potatoes all the time long and jensen back in the finals grabs leblanc for
1:38
sazier and this leblanc was banned a lot of the games in the previous matchup as well they pair it with that lulu the
1:44
tried and true for the zerry so cloud9 they lock in a volatile kill based mid
1:50
lane match up here with the leblanc looking for kill setup with blabber that makes you think cloud9 will want to get
1:55
an aggressive jungle as well to pair with that leblanc and then have that scaling bottom lane for later absolutely
2:01
it's it's one of jensen's best champions not only just this year you know seven games on it 71 win rate for all time
2:07
about a 75 win rate on this champion has been so dominant on it over so many
2:13
years and jensen gonna be looking to assert that dominance here in mid lane against avida in game one
2:20
all right looking at the jungle pool fort blabber for possible pairings there with uh that leblanc they have banned
2:26
out the trundle as well you know 100 thieves trying to whittle down on that champion pool meanwhile cloud9 trying to
2:32
take out some of these supports these engages with sivir will they also ban on something like the soraka though you
2:38
know we have seen a lot of these other uh you know enchanter supports for the bottom lane here sivir definitely does
2:44
well uh you know with leona as well nautilus already banned out here amumu banned out they they're trying to take
2:50
away these front line engages from hunch of thieves well one more man to go you know
2:56
slippers out there you're matching some of the rules but not on this double indeed jungle band as trundle wukong are
3:01
gone and unanswered support right now saying yeah we think you'd rather engage on us poppy civil research kind of get you in
3:07
any way find a tank to start it out what's the final ban here for cloud9 i
3:12
feel like they might just continue to banning engage picks right who he has been kind of showing that he wants to go towards it but as you say soraka was big
3:19
yesterday i do think banning away the horn here makes sense um but it is interesting because hundred thieves are
3:25
on red side so it's not like they have to fourth fourth pick their top laner but i guess the assumption is because
3:31
they're already going heavily towards scaling that they would be able to grab it on four here take it away from fudge and thinking that that would perhaps
3:36
make too strong of a team fighting composition 400 with these hovers already i'm thinking it's gonna be some
3:42
sort of tank engage for someday in the top lane whether you lock in the soraka or the sona it is going to need a little
3:48
bit more front line 100 thief this is what we know from the team they always want this structured five on five and so
3:54
now it's on cloud nine what's gonna be the jungle pairing with this leblanc you still have lee sin
4:04
they're getting aggressive here in game one oh yeah this is the combo right here cannon and nocturne you turn off the
4:10
lights with the knocks on ultimate so you cannot spot the cannon flank it makes it incredibly difficult to mark
4:15
but it's a malphite coming out here from somebody he's gonna go comment malphite pretty much for sure i would think yeah
4:20
and malphite recently buffed as well here let's put it to the test immediately this cannon this is the pick
4:26
that we were wondering what is going to be the change this time around because the last three games of the previous
4:32
series hundred thieves they were not ready for it they perma-banned the cannon in the second phase this time
4:37
around though they've had time to prepare what their counter will be and this is so interesting because now it's all that pressure on someday to actually
4:43
be the one to lock down berserker because he is the only primary engage but if berserker has flashed you expect
4:49
him to be able to flash the malphite ultimate every single time so i do think 100 thieves is going to have some pressure on them to be constantly trying
4:55
to tax those one more time i want to hear it who's here for cloud nine
5:00
[Applause] hundred thieves fans you're not gonna
5:06
get out done are you louder this time who's here for 100 thieves
5:14
seem pretty close there i'm not gonna lie all right we gotta we do have comet
5:19
malphite so as expected we are having that but it is actually gonna be electrocute here for fudge so more
5:24
bursty rune set up here going to be interesting to see you know if he can actually get on that back line and it does make him more dangerous on these
5:30
flanking plays we see a lot more spell book cannon and things like that these days though so it is interesting to see
5:36
the adaptation yeah i think it's just looking for that burst damage as we said the back line here it's all about these flanks the
5:42
combination of nocturne and cannon one of the old tried and true turning off
5:47
the vision finding the flank for the cannon into the back line the electrocute gives you that burst damage to get through the soraka before the
5:54
healing starts to take over they want to make those team fights as short as they can some really interesting rune setups here as well for huhi so resolve primary
6:02
is pretty standard if you think you're going to be getting double pawn which is nocturne and kennen is going to do but he's actually scorched nimbus cloak as
6:08
his secondary here on the soraka so the nibisco to me seems like he's trying to actually kite out after the initial engage when he's spending the goss
6:14
spending the flash and the scorch is just really heavily towards the landing here soraka again can be a very powerful
6:20
laner people don't always traditionally think of it in that way but if you're actually for going points in the w early on multiple points in q and e uh you
6:27
really can crush in lane and as far as the jungler should be nocturne power clearing always looking for that level
6:33
six of course with this champion so blabber doing the red side star read down to krugs full clear up towards that
6:40
top side towards that malphite cannon matchup
6:45
trying to fight back with them seven of course going to go for the q spam mana always going to be the issue budget health bar versus some day's mana bar
6:51
i'm expecting as the levels come in for huhi to feel pretty good in his lane match of the undodgeable poke honestly
6:57
going for the aggressive option i think soraka should beat most enchanters in lane just i mean accused self-sufficient
7:02
120 health far difference yeah when it lands no level 1 skilled as much as that one so i think yeah saying i'm going to
7:08
poke you down we're going to have the defensive runes in primary but i want to win this lane and that's why it's so much on your opponent to be able to
7:14
actually dodge out on those queues if you're dodging out on those queues look how heavily sven just won that trade there steps forward past the queue and
7:20
is able to land that glitter lance and continually get those autos in on huey to chunk them down so you've got to keep dodging those out keep the soraka low
7:26
and this is where you can really punish this 100 thieves bot lane looks like we do have knocked her and spotted on the
7:31
ward here blabber comes around for an early gank towards mid but abu dhabi knows he's there good defensive warding
7:37
around the mid lane as somebody saw a lot of yesterday too for the early stages of the matchup when you pick
7:43
leblanc into azir a lot of the matchup is on getting kills and kill threat with your jungler if you're left alone just
7:50
to have the azir free farming pushing you in under tower you're slowly going to lose out and lose out more of your
7:57
presence someday chunk down to 200 b chugs a biscuit it looks like the end right there he get himself healthy closer
8:04
split crabs one and one with the cloud9 jungler so far 20 of the way towards the wind
8:11
here on clef on uh on blapper's side 70 more he gets for now gonna be really interesting to see where somebody goes
8:16
with the build you know did get pushed back pretty early picks up a doran's ring for some mana regen as well as the refillable i'm expecting him just go
8:22
towards tank but some players in these matchups if you're going to play more heavily for that 1v1 will go towards
8:27
something like an everfrost even at times uh or some of those ap mythics yeah definitely definitely do expect
8:35
pretty heavy tank front line as far as hunting thieves and how they build their teams around that late game team
8:41
fighting around fbi and abu dhabi speaking of which uh jensen with a really good shove here on the leblanc
8:47
the early stages of this leblanc azir matchup going so well for him nice cs lead he's been able to accrue gets off
8:53
an easy back for the early recall here as well double amp tums teleports right back out and blabber is on his second
9:00
clear for the knock turn and now with abu dhabi on no mana he can try to push him back on an awkward timing right you
9:06
can try to shove this in four sabados a base when it's not potentially a cannon wave there but abu dhabi looking like
9:11
he'll just try to clear this out and likely base on this wave uh to come back exactly try and pressure him lose out on
9:17
every few cs does or really matter another electrocute park from fudge as he tries
9:24
to whittle down on someday and fudge is actually doing a really good job because he hasn't actually based yet abu dhabi could be in some
9:30
trouble here but no ignite means he's gonna be okay to back it up um because fudge is still taxing the resources of
9:35
someday post teleport so if he can keep him locked in this lane utilize the energy bar just continue poking away
9:40
you're resourceless there on the cannon then you tp back and you can really try to punish someday when you have that
9:46
full health plus a really good buy try to push someday back on a bad time and tv comes in now for the mid lane abu
9:52
dhabi finally pushed back in he's got not quite what he wants he would love lost champs okay make it happen the bot side sven's gonna be slowed tag up for a
9:59
bit but will they kill him face rushes move speed they won't root him in place zen burns a summoner heal to stay alive
10:05
he's staying cool he's got the teemo thumbs up he knows he's going to take damage mid lane flapper returns but how does it get through this one he's not
10:11
level six just yet the fear is going to land he flashes he still gets fear knock turns on the way and knock knock dance
10:19
door has arrived abaddaga trying to wait so long to dodge out on the chain but he gets caught by the fear by blabber
10:25
instead waited too long on it cloud9 strike first exactly the tether are just
10:31
barely not broken with the flash into shifting sands and it is going to be mid
10:37
jungle duo with the first kill it goes on to the doctor and flappers not done he's looking top side look at this rome
10:43
from leblanc and nocturne majority oldest someday has haze so someone pulls that girl there's a chance
10:48
he can lock him in turret there's no teleport from his ear there's no help coming for someday got the passive shield means bonus armor flashed away
10:55
from the tether here comes the 3v1 leblanc is on he holds it for the cannon who had afro but fudge lives with five
11:02
health left cloud nine get it all they get in top lane they get it in mid lane
11:07
fudge barely surviving there and someday loses all of that wave no tp no flash
11:13
nothing he can do about it this is so big for slingshotting this knock turn ahead blabber is now level six with the
11:20
nocturne two can repeat gank there are guess what no flashes on either solo
11:25
lane now so blabber is in the dream world for nocturne right now 100 thieves they do on the other
11:31
side of it since you see the rome top side from mid and jungle they will get the dragon in payment for the life of
11:38
someday and look at blabber he's moving towards midlane right now can they lock him down though underneath
11:44
the turret ulti is available but knows he could spell shields could be needed to flabber is fine obanaga burns nothing
11:49
to get away jensen flash to follow yeah a little bit of a missed timing there from cloud9 need to let that chain be
11:54
setting it up first jensen tries to flash in to make something happen with that play but avanaga quick on the slide
12:00
out yeah that was actually amazing for 100 thieves to to get the first nocturn ultimate down big timing window now and
12:07
the flash from jensen used they they could really feel the extra tension here game one of finals you really wanted to
12:14
jump on that momentum that they built on both those solo lane kills and we haven't even really checked in on bot lane but berserkers opened up a 9 cs
12:21
lead down in bot lane so it's three winning lanes right now for cloud nine this does mean uh that blapper is gonna
12:27
kind of have the run of things in the jungle right now but it's actually someday starting up harold as closer is
12:32
here around mid and flabbers back in base ghost is on ulti chasing an fbi can't jump any walls
12:38
himself decent damage they don't couple the shots ultimately fbi is able to just walk this one away who he with the heel
12:44
berserker down an ulti and a summoner for nothing yeah i love it they're giving him a taste of their own medicine with these emotes uh as soon as they
12:51
know they're not in danger it will be on the other side of the map another neutral objective for 100 thieves pick
12:56
up so cloud9 getting these early kills but 100 thieves they stay focused on the objectives here on the map picking up
13:03
rift road on the top side is actually going to go a long way yeah i mean getting both dragon and harold i think you're completely fine with being down
13:10
1k for that especially when they do have you know really really good scaling here obviously with these here with the
13:15
silver 100 things i think pretty happy with these first few minutes shield from zen and blocks the back half
13:20
of boomerang blade but fbi is going to be down about seven cs as the wave gets manicured out you know not a huge deal
13:26
and yeah you mentioned the scoreboard at the very top a thousand gold versus the objectives and with 100 thieves you know
13:32
getting 300 gold ones carol to summon at the very least it's yeah looking pretty solid here so a pretty close early game
13:37
so far yeah i think the next steps for cloud9 is try and leverage the advantage that they already got on the successful
13:43
game the nocturne and leblanc get jensen roaming around with the timing for next knocker and ultimate coming up paranoia
13:50
the cooldown is almost available here really good warp from hunter thieves has been able to scout out blabber um but
13:55
those two have so much so much power right now and finding a kill on that second
14:00
ultimate is gonna feel so important especially after the the first one really did not get you any rewards when you're playing nocturne almost always
14:06
it's rinse and beat ulti on cooldown try to get a kill and then just get back to power farming as fast as you can plus
14:12
you're always thinking i wanna use it before soraka gets level six but now huhi just thinks level six so they have the extra soraka ultimate for safety for
14:19
protection on the hundredth side moser sneaks in from the brush smite fight could be available uh only cloud
14:25
nine who has it he goes early claims it anyway but a miss smite all the same still two minutes on the drink to come
14:30
up but blue buff is stolen by the cloud9 side and cloud9 trying to use the prior that they have now to extend their advantage here you know jensen had abu
14:37
dhaba zoned away on mid lane was on the left side of your screen and you know pushing him away from that blue buff if
14:43
a fight broke out jensen would always get there before abu dhabi and that would likely mean it goes hot nine's way
14:48
yeah and refocusing on the hundred thieves goals here they're just trying to farm as much as they can on their sharima carries azir and sivir both
14:55
funnel as much cs as you can into them malphite yeah you're you're gonna be on tank duty up on top side soak up as much
15:02
as you can without opening up too much of an opportunity for cloud nine
15:07
decent chain decent damage but he's like yeah we gonna erase that one nice try jensen i press w2 buddy the soraka roam
15:14
is the deadliest walks through mid lane heals him up walks away my job here is done
15:20
ambulance has arrived turret plate almost about to fall off dude jensen with the constant pushing here on the
15:25
block really pressuring the match up from the where to go and you can see that fbi is actually
15:32
heading out towards top lane the herald's already down but looks like they're moving towards top lane to try to get malphite out of this matchup
15:38
where he's been struggling maybe set up a herald play poppy's up in that top side jungle with huhi send up fbi push
15:43
this in on fudge drop the herald and make sure that you can cash in before 14 minutes and i want to see how many
15:48
turret plates terry actually gets for this because that leaves berserker bottom lane just chucking away at these
15:54
turret plates there's one knocked off already sven is even staying around to help him with it buff him up take it
15:59
down even quicker alpha could always be a threat of course level nine has a bombing cinder and
16:05
enough ap to at least be a threat here as blabber sees the top winner under fire 1v3 fights coming back in i don't
16:11
think either side can win a fight around here the turret would be too much and you don't run a 2v3 against the healer so it's gonna be the wave going down
16:17
it's gonna be a second turret plate likely shared three ways so 53 and a third gold each not a huge
16:23
deal but as you're mentioning botlane's still under pressure as well the 2v1 down there the extra number is creating extra pressure
16:29
and committing that tp is really just trying to make sure that they can actually crack the full tower they're hoping that they can maybe win that race
16:34
on the bottom side or at the very least delay it but again blabber getting pulled back up towards that top side to try to defend they're gonna look for the
16:40
play going for top side getting over the top but it's not enough damage wish comes through and cloud nine wish they
16:46
hadn't gone for this one helpers getting lost i don't know they don't get him just yet knocked for the flash through the heel means one the
16:52
fear needs a flash for the other and a blabber has knocked him out two versus three oh blabbers trying to chase them
16:59
all down he gets one of them in the 2v3 for fudge and blapper the nocturne
17:06
cannon combination and they try and shove it right down 100 thieves throat but a little bit of a wrap around
17:11
they're trying to catch the decent recall let one go and catch the other one
17:18
nearly finds the kill but not there so smart from 100 thieves there they've got the vision of the wards they wait for
17:24
the desync on those recalls and strike at the precise moment yeah really really intelligent stuff there but still
17:30
blabber and fudge they defend the tower and they force five summoners with that
17:35
fight all four from the bot lane plus the flash off of closer there that is a really big deal flabbert one of those
17:42
players who is just historically always known as limits better than anyone else you know always playing to the edge had
17:48
this ride breaker and felt he could make the play also nocturne is very snowbally early on in the game and blabber getting
17:53
a lot of this early money so let's take another look at it they did a vision when he started
17:58
they sink the two cooldowns there exhaust was used to mitigate some of the damage oh and flower got pushed off of
18:04
cloud drake he was soloing it has tons of damage early on with these fell shield the autos but as center things come down in time it's two drakes now to
18:11
100 thieves sure the herald charge charge enough only many three turret plates taken top that's been about a wash with the c9 bottom pressure but a
18:18
thousand gold difference is now a two drake difference as well on the other side exactly pretty big here 400 these to be able to stack these dragons again
18:24
they're the team comp that wants to group up as five and then the number one priority as they go later into the game
18:30
keeping track of fudge somebody marked that cannon because when the lights go out with the paranoia it's gonna be very
18:36
hard to stop that flank and you see the ftx total goal berserker and blabber topping the charge just barely ahead
18:41
there of fbi now somebody is way down but it's more okay on the malphite he doesn't need to be the focus here you
18:48
know just working towards the tank mythic needs to be that engage and honestly your all fixed is the same way they have one items or five
18:54
i like this build those stride breaker on nocturne he's and we saw on the gold graph right like he was you know top two
19:00
goal to the game high that anyone else on hundred thieves nocturne can solo people at equal level up in gold if if
19:06
someone is alone they are dying to paranoia yeah i think the next big goal for cloud9 is trying to get these side
19:12
turrets down and to do that you need harold get that that charge so you can immediately get more territory to pick
19:18
people off leblanc nocturne cannon all looking you know to play with more fog of war and i completely you know agree
19:24
with you for when you're talking about that and that's why there's been such a focus on vision right they have this big line of words these words over the wall
19:30
all trying to cover uh potential areas you know that they would have to actually watch out for nocturne from and
19:36
it's gonna be this vision battle where 509 are trying to constantly sweep out any forward wards so blabber can have
19:42
good angles to actually alt from sure it's going to be going down there it is cloudy who got second herald
19:47
themselves so first turn the game that should be a race easily won by cloud nine as long as you stay away
19:53
you're giving all this gold to berserker 450 on to him harold will not steal turret gold only plate money so
19:59
berserker off the races 6500 the problem with trying to match on
20:04
bottom side two for 100 thieves the herald is going to get two towers in the time you get one tower so cloud nine
20:10
really really hyper focused on that priority take down these outer towers for 100 thieves shove as deep as you can
20:16
into their territory to then move to stage two of the plan get those picks
20:21
absolutely and i do wonder you know if they're going to be able to really find that team fight on the on the team side at this third dragon because i think
20:27
that's where we're gonna see cloud9 say all right enough is enough you've got the first two dragons we've established our gold lead now we're gonna fight you
20:33
at that third dragon and as long as berserker has summoners and they can track someday he should be able to respond to that malphite and malphite
20:39
really is just gonna be basically an alt and that's it and if you can't lock down this area with the malphito i feel like
20:45
it's gonna be so hard for a hundred thieves to ever actually take him out yeah agreed just depends what the dive ends up looking like if it does land or
20:51
not berserker it's gonna be up to his toes and as then has the shields and the ulti to keep him alive even if does land
20:57
might be enough just space spilt with fudge and blabber diving in as well it's going to be very fun to watch these team
21:03
fights play out 20 300 gold lead right now for cloud nine moving up towards a very slow to kill third dragon and
21:10
mountain in two minutes yeah and i like their their priority they switch everybody away from the top side try and
21:15
push it in as quickly as they possibly can 100 thieves doing a good job though tracking cloud nine not giving them an
21:21
opening to get one of those picks burn those summoner spells those flashes before that dragon arrives
21:30
ward's killed mid lane once again take him at the 80 carries leblanc happier to side lane pretty good escape tools
21:36
overall and probably not get caught up by anything as fudge stays the far side teleports will be up for every soil
21:41
laner in time for this mountain drake fight in 75 seconds all right keep your eyes peeled for any teleport flank wards
21:47
a ward for fudge to teleport in on as the cooldown on his ugly cell port is coming up pretty shortly here could be
21:54
devastating and you see that little little controller there that sneaker in the blue
21:59
uh jungle area here of hundred thieves that would be the ward okay
22:05
yeah he goes back because that would actually been game-changing if he gets a flanking tv and you lose that fight off that uh
22:10
berserker should have hurricane now he was actually sticking around you know a little bit of a later back but still 45 seconds before the dragon should be on
22:17
his second item here he has really been accelerated out into this game sells the call and that should give him
22:23
combination goal here there it is he's going to be on two items fbi will not be able to actually get to that mark i
22:28
don't think unless he can pick up some jungle camps or something prior to that fight seems unlikely calls 183 gold and he got
22:34
donated a lot of money yeah we're we're actually about there 650 for a phantom racer combined i think so uh should be
22:40
pretty close in the ability to do so if he's willing to get the recall off uh but we're gonna see our fight going on pretty soon as we are into the bottom
22:46
river 15 seconds of mountain drake hunter thieves would be on soul point and it would stymie so much of what
22:52
kennen and knocked knoxville want to do with those tank stats and look at this leblanc setting up on the bottom side trying to find a flanking angle in from
22:58
the side they're going to look for the pincer play here jensen has not been spotted timing on the exhaust for mahuhi on this
23:04
cannon too mark the cannon big aoe damage possible cloud9 getting the river first someday on a war but he's going to
23:11
kill it and get rid of the fog can he find the right dive jensen seam at the ward over the wall no super available to
23:16
get rid of that one but drake is being started someday hits the front line no one's on a flank angle cloud nine are
23:22
spotted poke for the dog it means very little who he's safe enough for now fudge faints it doesn't go in his flash
23:29
the only tool available closer she burns the ulti long cooldown hits no one
23:34
shock hits fbi he spell shields it jensen's still waiting in the wings again this time kills the ward will
23:39
kennen go for a flash ulti over the wall is he walking for the flank he is 100 thieves have low time who he's at half
23:46
health turns off the lights the moose beat comes in here's the dive shuffled out
23:51
still hit three and gents and kills zamanaga tau knight in for more jensen will not die blabber will stop watch a
23:58
trade two for one who he flashing out jensen gets to third a fourth chase down
24:03
by berserker and closer is the last man standing runs for the hills and clouds
24:10
not get what they want the patience on fudge there under the cover of darkness
24:16
he gets the flank on cannon even with abu dhabi seeing him with the azir all trying to push him out he still flash
24:22
forward gets the aoe down and cloud nine get their fight and i would love to see
24:28
this replay from the under thieves pov because that is where where it really shows you the terror of this combination
24:34
you know being able to see jensen on the side they sweep out the ward they have an idea that fudge is gonna be coming around from this angle but they don't
24:40
know the exact timing they're not sure when it's gonna happen when the lights turn off it's all chaos because you lose
24:46
total sight of this upper ward area fudge is coming down you see him now you see that in goes nocturne from the side
24:53
he flashes in they try to disengage it with the azir ultimate but fudge is still in the middle of everyone and the
24:58
lulu walt knocks up three huge huge stuff there and then with all the focus
25:03
on that cannon and nocturne on the front lines berserker is just free firing on
25:09
the zerry running them down really beautiful like i can't think
25:15
but hand it to abu dhabi who did play that fight perfectly you can only rely on your own vision your rewards turn off
25:21
your teammates and turns off he's the one who's like he's coming from top side saw it scooped in time and there is
25:27
still yeah he's done only 2 000 damage but it's still 2 000 damage setting up for berserker and now we get a fight in
25:32
the top river and zven is able to flash barely staying alive critically he's able to stay alive there
25:38
100 thieves though trying to establish vision control here around the baron they are very far down they know they
25:44
cannot afford to give over a free baron to cloud9 that would likely spend the spell the end of game one and they have
25:49
to be very worried about the next three and a half minutes because that's where cloud9's comp actually has an even
25:54
bigger advantage in picking off people without summoner spells the team fights are are huge and meaningful but yet the
26:01
time in between where nocturne gets to threaten and pick you off while you've spent all your summoner spells during
26:06
the team fight is actually terrifying it's so tough because they didn't even get the flash off berserker in that team
26:12
fight yes he used the ghost but they were never even able to force that so it's not like you can say oh well it's a free mountain they're gonna look on the
26:17
side scoop there's no way you're gonna slap this one at 3v1 nocturne flies zippy's against the crown so he gets nothing
26:23
done i think you hold this one try to find your way back in afterwards closer dodge the chain the entire team is here
26:29
and the fbi ults they cannot keep up with the rest of cloud9 just the one for zero that's huge props to 200 thieves
26:35
taking control of the map because they know if we split up the nocturne's gonna pick us off while we're weak so they
26:40
make the pick first they take it to cloud nine to get at least something and it's really smart because they know
26:45
fudge for sure had no flash he has no way to actually respond to that malphite ultimate so good targeting there but
26:50
it's pretty terrifying i.e gold",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFe2n8AU9ok
blue,JDG,369,KANAVI,YAGAO,HOPE,MISSING,red,RGE,ODOAMNE,MALRANG,LARSSEN,COMP,TRYMBI,JDG,"0:00
say it immediately gets locked in I think removing that from yagao makes a lot of sense now Asia being up and
0:06
available of course you do run the risk of handing this over to yagao Rogue after of known and be prepared for this
0:12
because not only is it giving it to you guys also taking it away from Larson one of his most comfortable Champions the
0:18
question is what will his answer to the champion be yeah and just one of the most popular for the tournament overall
0:24
one thing they could be thinking for jdg is that they'll let the azir go through and counter it with an akali pick from
0:30
yagao one of the counters is still up there for him to pick they could also go with Victor to match scaling that is not
0:37
looking for the kill counter though all right well we've got that azir locked in for rogue locked in for Larson here the
0:43
other pick in the first round of the draft for rogue here is the Lucian 71 win rate on this Champion world so far
0:49
and instantly the answer here the avellios Lulu the popper uh popular counter pick into the Lucian Nami it
0:57
hasn't had quite as much success since those Nerfs to lose though especially the early Lane phase for the Lucian Nami
1:03
has just been outstanding but it seems the jdg have come in very
1:09
prepared to know exactly what Rogue was going to do and they've secured a first half of the draft they
1:15
seem very comfortable with giving kanavi something that gives him a lot of agency a little bit more scaling and a lot more threat later into the game we now just
1:22
need to see a little bit more initiation and utility to come from this team because remember they've removed both orn and maokai in a draft like this you
1:28
would expect 369 to be bringing those engaged tools to give jdg the options to start fighting and you have to start
1:34
thinking uh about mauron champion pool as well you expect since no jungle was picked up for rogue you know something
1:39
like that Jarvan does find its way here maurang has simply been too impactful with this champion on these early ganks
1:47
and there it is kind of the no-brainer for jdg exactly get rid of one of those engagers get rid of one of those
1:53
Playmakers Victor band away that was one of the Champions you suggested talking about if you want to scale next to them
1:59
well you're not going to be able to do that this time around will Rogue also ban out the akali the other Champion
2:05
that was suggested as an answer here into giving away the azir they said they could let it through because only has
2:11
two lifetime games on Holly that never means that a player is not able to pull
2:16
the champion out but it does lower a bit sometimes the pick and ban priority on it as far as a best of five as well
2:23
feeling out jdg and seeing if yagao is in the state right now where he feels comfortable picking it and the last band
2:29
of the second half here another one looking at odawamne the Gnar banned out here but I think though with sejuan is
2:35
still open this becomes the best pick for rogue right now when they need to what it's debatable it depends if they
2:40
want to try and give count a total on me or not but when you look at what jdg needs it is that form of initiation and I think that if you just take the
2:46
sejuani away it's 369 though and you're gonna take away three six nines Renekton I love it
2:53
here oh no I'm gonna yoink it for himself let's see what the response is instantly it's that gragas that we
2:59
talked up and jdg need that big front line on their side uh as well and then
3:05
yagao has been so so happy with the Talia as specifically either Ari counter
3:11
or azir counter for him he is a very strongly in Lane with some possible kill threat here uh as well as roaming around
3:18
to set up the side Lanes alrighty and our last pick of the draft for rogue it's devised so there's some more
3:24
initiation there's some of that powerful lockdown onto these immobile carries of the Talia of the ofelios that is how are
3:30
we feeling about this draft now that we're seeing all 10 pieces well I'll say that it was surprisingly quick it seems that both teams knew exactly what they
3:36
wanted and they knew how the opposition would react jdg have a very typical front to back Style with a little bit more of a carry or into jungler with
3:43
Rogue doing a similar thing but they have a little bit more options in the early game with the vi with the same single Target lockdown I think they're
3:49
going to be looking to play through the bot side of the map as I think which heavily favored the Chinese Representatives now the all-time
3:56
head-to-head investor Farsi is eight to four in favor of the
4:02
LPL while Europe have been able to upset here and there historically elkiel has always had Europe's number but now we
4:09
get to see the lpl's number one seed against the early sees number one see the best of the best from both regions
4:15
let's see what both teams can bring Champions the versus Champions right here LPL versus EU
4:23
and the crowd going wild early some Vision down here on bottom side trying to get Vision both of the brush as well
4:29
as uh possible early alert for a late invade there is a sweeper already started for kanabi uh on the graves so
4:37
maybe you get a late invade towards top side of the map as well Ping's coming out already and I like this on a
4:42
champion like Graves who is such an Adept duelist in the early game being able to come out on top in a lot of
4:48
these Skirmish situations and there it is jdg with a late invade odumne we'll
4:54
see them there but won't do anything about it I love doing this for Graves jungle especially when you do have uh
5:00
the matchup on the other side of the map like that to split meaning Mauro also always does this control word start
5:06
whether it is Jarvan or the vi here placing the extra Vision through a little pixel brush on bottom side to
5:13
allow for some of those uh you know ganks towards the bottom side River see Lawson already looking to get the push
5:18
in the mid lane he has dropped that little Ward keep an eye on what kanabi is up to we'll see how Mal adapts his
5:24
party and he will spot out the graves doing the Raptors you would expect man running to go from blue and then move towards the pot side of kanavi's jungle
5:30
the problem he has he has no push in the pot Lane you may be able to usurp that with the fact that Larson has to push in mid but canvas gonna come through and
5:37
help alleviate some of that pressure yeah it's just so nicely done here from jdg setting up for Jungle success they
5:43
showed early priority on the graves champion and now with this counter jungle splitting through the other side you take away so much uh area that
5:50
Mallory has to work with here he's going to get his level three on his VI off of purely this blue quadrant of the Jungle
5:57
but now it gets difficult for him because he's kind of forced into making a gank or going all the way up towards
6:04
countering the blue quadrant there of kanabi and he is passing up towards that
6:09
northern half of the map his own top laner is very far extended here as Odo is taking control of the lane nice and
6:15
early getting 369 shoved in he will want to crash this wave up here in the meantime Mal rang clearing out the krugs
6:22
the one camp that was left not stolen away like enough and good job here kanabi crosses back so he's just
6:28
eliminating any other possible areas for maurang to farm right now after krugs
6:33
gonna come over and look for the Scuttle crab fight odorama is pushing up so nice to have your pushing top side here maybe
6:40
Mount rain will be able to get over for spawn of scuttle crap but Odo thinking a pretty big trade
6:46
ready but 369 he's gonna be looking for it he doesn't know but the Buy's here though
6:52
3-6-9 you think he would have saw it right there in the brush but no the damage comes out three six nine with 100
6:58
HP still trying to get away from this one he'll survive and now Kanani's made his way into the top side River it's a
7:04
Flash coming oh there won't be a kill just yet one for one who are the top laners as Kenobi versus Mal rang now
7:11
turns into a duel it's a level Advantage here for kanavi Mal rang getting himself
7:17
back into the brush charging up the Vault breaker kanavi doesn't want to give him an easy target teleports bringing both top laners back into the
7:23
fight back into the mix Odo shows up and protects Mal rang's ex it is in the end
7:29
first blood for rogue they get the kill first there for Odo and with the lane
7:35
pushing back towards him immediate teleport right back out he's going to be in a pretty good State as soon as he's
7:40
able to equalize in that way meanwhile Myron did use Flash there on the vi and teleporting back the only problem is
7:46
there is exact timer for kanavi on these Raptors so kanavi should be able to get second steal on the Raptor Camp from
7:53
Maori as well continue to counter jungle it and there he goes right for it as well that's going to be number two
7:58
taking off the Navy's whole path thing to say the game has been immaculate the fact that he started red into Rafters
8:03
moved into his bot side Raptors to cover for the potential invade into his red buff he then passed up towards his blue
8:09
saying the other option the maurang has if he doesn't come into the bot side he could try and cross map top side he covered for that as well and then he was
8:15
in a position to come up for the early gank as well and ends up trading one for one so overall really smart pathing and he's a large part of why they were able
8:21
to get something off the back of this and you can see odawani well it looks like a bad trade initially in 369 sees the window he knows the Renekton
8:27
cooldowns are very high early on maurang at the last second though shows up and is able to come in for the counter gang
8:32
but at this point they're not quite close enough to get the kill it's the moment that 369 comes back into the lane the Ottawa sees his win and Odo knows
8:38
there's no flash on 369 so he goes right for it flash hits the sun slice and Dyson even though he has to take the
8:45
tower shot does get the first Blood bonus then in the aftermath could I be obviously pushing that wave as well and
8:50
Odo teleporting back so look at this you have to take into account not just the first blood but also the Cs afterwards
8:57
with that big pushing wave quite nice for the Renekton in the one versus one so while Mal rank has sustained a bit of
9:03
a deficit in the jungle and that's just a single small Raptor that he clears out there because it was counter jungle
9:09
kanavi uh leaving one behind it does mean that Otto is set up for success the awkward thing for maurango is his whole
9:15
path it's kind of been messed up now in terms of this other game he's still able to help out his Top Lane and get a bit of an advantage and I think that was
9:21
really important especially in the Odo versus 369 matchup but when you look at this Lucian Army this is the lane that
9:26
you typically want to try and enable the only plan here I can see for rogue is we get closer to the minimal for the renekto being stronger Rogue is looking
9:33
to try and contest that first Herald and then they bring it down towards the bot side of the map to then involve the solution and army more into the game and
9:40
it's nice that we're seeing as well the reason why we keep talking about whoa oh okay not quite low here with all we got
9:46
a little bit of a scuffle Odo goes into ulti knavy's coming up through the brush Rogue have their jungler nearby maurang
9:52
is undetected for now kanabi throwing a bunch of damage straight into the brush there dashes forward put the bullet in
9:59
his back Mal rang has to run and jdg just get the better of him canaveri once
10:05
again in the perfect position on the map level six for the graves 40 50 CS now at
10:12
just short of seven minutes this man has been leveraging his early priority perfectly and has been putting on a
10:18
jungle Master Class within the first seven minutes and every juggler does this feeling it is so nice to be this
10:24
ahead on graves getting to your early serrated Dirk a massive power Spike there is going for the red steal and
10:30
odawana wants to protected one for his jungler all right coming in too but they won't be able to close that distance Kobe I like how you're saying every
10:36
jungler knows this feeling talking about being ahead I think everybody knows what it feels like playing against fed Graves
10:42
and it is not a good time cannot be taken over the early game here and forcing out a flash in the mid lane from
10:47
Lars meanwhile we have seen the why the uh this of felios plus Lulu has been kind of the popular answer into the
10:54
Lucian Nami early on Hope and missing doing an absolutely amazing job down there on the bottom side since there was
11:00
so much jungle attention focused towards the top side of the map they were left complete alone in the 2v2 and have been
11:06
able to utilize that extra early power there to be able to get a nice little bit of a CS lead for themselves off of
11:13
the early recalls though see if it starts to turn back around it's just it's so impressive to see how kanavi
11:19
plays around where he has pressure on the map and as you're right they said Kobe this bot Lane just keeps leveraging their range the early range advantage
11:26
that they have means that they can just keep pushing keep pushing and they don't have to worry about the enemy jungle because of what kanavi is doing on the
11:31
map is this great relationship between jungler and laners that's facing basically giving jdg a lot of options
11:37
and you can see now they've been able to accrue a small early game called advantage and a lot of that is sitting on the movie who's now level seven and
11:43
it's a perfect timing for kanabi to recall after that blue blood steal you once you get this power Spike of the
11:49
umbral glaive you have so much vision control as well as burst potential here for kanavi so level seven with the
11:56
umbral glaive the first completed item in the entire game and of course the zombie Awards you get to take away and
12:02
make the map complete really dark four Rogue while putting up your own and that vision control scales with your lead
12:08
because all of a sudden you walk into a brush that you don't have control over that Graves can threaten 100 to zero
12:14
against you if you're not ready for it we'll see how he's able to utilize that and keep this Tempo going here as
12:20
Larson's got control over the mid lane you can see that is one of the bigger CS advantages that Rogue have found for
12:25
themselves just about nine minutes into the game Harold is up kanavi's here in the top side River again but there is
12:31
vision of this pit Rogue does have the ward there in the back knavy's gonna find it and they're going for this off
12:36
of the support recall timer you see the room here from Lulu uh missing goes straight out through mid lane roams over
12:43
to support this play on Harold I think Rogue gonna make the correct call here give that up and play towards the bottom
12:50
side instead oh nice little bit of a Juggle there from three six nine knocking odawam they
12:57
back into him away from the turret 369 not afraid to aggressively use these ultimates just to trade get some
13:02
advantages here in the lane kanabi is going to secure the eye of the herald there for the side of jdg as Rogue as
13:09
maurang and trimby working together to take down the first Drake of the game not an exceptionally quick one not an
13:14
exceptionally slow one but it will be that first Cloud Drake here for the side of robe this thing will see them take it
13:19
with the ward over the wall into the pit but that's about it so objectives traded across the map here with those first two
13:25
neutrals the main problem for rogue now is the way in which city she can use this good knockback good damage nicely
13:31
done remember Larson doesn't have a flash now ranks thinking about coming in but Larson gets himself away enough
13:37
loses a big chunk of HP there and this is now gonna free up yagal to roam with kanavi and look for an opportunity
13:44
elsewhere and you can see the attention to detail there from jdg as well they're immediately peeking out mauron could
13:49
probably be here on bottom side uh through this River for the vi counter so they don't over taste let's get their
13:55
little chunks push out the wave and continue rotating through bottom Scuttle crab picked up and a little bit of extra
14:00
Vision left through the blue quadrant I just can't get over how well cannabi is playing this other game you can see the gold that he's been able to accrue for
14:07
himself level eight now on the graves his his farming has been immaculate his positioning has been great and it's just
14:13
he is making it so easy for the jdg laners to play we can see how oppressive Lawson is being in the isolated 1v1 and
14:20
the second he sees a small window where he can push the lead canavi is there every time the top Lane's in danger Kenobi is there oh the bot Lane wasn't
14:26
he's literally just covering for every single laner and Roe feels very limited in terms of what options they have in
14:32
the early game yeah he's done a magnificent job actually manipulating his route so he can both deny some camps
14:38
to Mal rang as well as support the lanes in their needs if someone cannabi uh has
14:43
really shown through with and you can see in the build too with that umbral glaive already completed like you mentioned Kobe now with the iron Spike
14:49
whip going towards the gore Drinker you're up against a short range 80 carry and two melee Fighters that's going to
14:55
be a lot of Team fight healing once we start getting into these bigger fights yeah the bow build uh definitely found a
15:01
lot of success with that one as well missing and konavi coming over with a double jungle support team up here
15:07
towards mid lane look to get the push in and start to test this vision and the bolt side of
15:14
the map we can see the Lucian moving back out onto the map as well looked like he was passing towards him it decided against that but Romney does
15:19
have the TP but it's not quite Unleashed it looks like there's no real objective it's just a bit of a dance for these River boards yup still two more minutes
15:26
before those teleports become Unleashed and two minutes also how much time remains on the eye of
15:31
the herald remember that cannabi secured it but it has not been used yet the Indigo were roaming towards bottom see
15:38
if there was an opportunity there earlier after chunking out Larson but it didn't turn into anything so I'm curious
15:43
where jdg is going to choose to use this because they've got about 60 seconds left yeah I would love it if they could
15:49
just pop it mid lane here because you really want to unlock ikao on this Talia he just finished Crown has ultimate
15:55
ready can start to make some roam plays so if you spend extra resources get a little bit of a pressure gank there and
16:01
plus take down on some of the turret plates some security move in for some extra counter jungling first though as
16:07
he takes away red buff and looks for the dive oh boy let's see here now that
16:13
they've given up their information though knowing there's a ward in here that is scouted out for rogue there's probably going to be a cover uh assuming
16:20
they are for kanabi so immediately moves off and on their own controller behind Red buff they do see the support coming
16:25
from Rogue so they don't overextend for now Rogue just gonna play it on the
16:31
defensive once again imagine the next big point of contention will be the dragon spawning in about a minute and a half let's see where this Herald end up
16:38
going can I be making a feline towards the flat side of the map you can see they have the push trading continues in the Top Lane but I really don't expect
16:44
either top laner to be able to kill each other oh we're actually going to drop the Harold this was something you were talking about Kobe oh hold on again much
16:52
lower but I imagine he'll just go back to base does have the TP to return to Lane yeah 369 having the Mythic
16:57
completed with that iceborn Gauntlet is so scary compared to Otto still just working with components that's gonna be
17:03
a kill a nice shot from yagal sets it up for Konami to knock it and the surprise
17:09
Pikachu face comes up here from missing there with you just getting a pick for
17:14
free under Tower while they're sieging they just walk away with it hope though hope a little bit far forward now in a
17:21
1v2 he will fall and whoa will find the kill for Khan what a bold move here from
17:26
mauron that timing window was very close bowring says hey they're taking my blue right now because we lost mid pressure
17:33
we have a small timing window maybe 10 seconds to go for this kill on to Hope while he's by himself he does not
17:39
hesitate for rogue there ultimate in on the vi nice little pickup in a bad situation so we're 14 minutes in now we
17:46
were talking about this being a big moment like the Drake is gonna spawn soon turret plates on your screen 800
17:52
gold in place for jdg versus absolutely no plates taken for rogue the laning
17:58
phase going the way of the LPL Squad let's take another look at how you gal found this cause wham bam yeah the
18:05
herald charge moves trimby out a little bit and then he walks a little bit forward there you go right with the
18:10
seismic shove insta kills but this is that little timing window we're talking about yeah you called it perfectly Kobe
18:16
because I was just about to comment on how jdg are gonna get so much off the back of this play Their Eyes Were set on
18:22
security bring that bot Tower as well and if it weren't for that play for maurang this whole situation could have looked a lot worse gdg now starting off
18:30
the Drake choosing not to go for it trippy is nice to sneak into the brush oh trippy's ready to go with the ulti
18:35
coming out and once again there's no hope for Hope cop gets another so Rogue
18:41
are finally able to get a little bit more action out onto the man narang is finding opportunities as we see more fighting in the Top Lane Top Lane just
18:49
never ends up here Odo trying to scrap with him a little bit but 369 is on a free and that should be a bottom side
18:56
objective sorry for rogue as well really nice call in the first game Power he
19:01
burns both Summoners off the hope and now they're thinking immediately punish this 80 carry no Summoner spells on hope
19:07
so trimby swims his way into the side brush and row capitalize on it and
19:12
earned themselves an objective back that's two dragons actually stacking very quickly and pedious I do believe it
19:18
was you who said you wanted to see Rogue play through the bot Lane right you wanted to see the them go here and
19:24
prioritize these guys enable these guys comp having two kills having the gale force feels nice trendy with a nice side
19:30
step against the seismic shove make sure that he doesn't get picked off by yagao he and Mal rang invading the enemy
19:36
jungle Now setting up jdg for more success here in the bottom Lane setting up road for more success here at the
19:41
bottom Lane excuse me as jdg are the ones taking the second Herald here in the top side yeah it's um it's a weird
19:47
map state right now as you go oh what's the flash out maurang should be getting his first red buff of the game as odwame
19:53
finds himself in some danger you have 369 keeping him away from his own turret here just allowing that to Devour the
19:59
entire minion wave he's got missing right next to him to guarantee that Odo can't just force himself back underneath
20:04
this objective and now the konami's up here he's got the second Herald jdg is going for the cross map but look at bolt
20:11
Lane alright has the ultimate and he knows that yakaw is around with no flash available bro could continue to push in
20:17
this mod side of the map there are pings on the mid lane Tower here comes the alt okay it's not gonna find a whole lot
20:22
there goes was uh swinging a Miss Honestly though um yagao respected that
20:28
place so much that's why he flashed over the red buff wall as soon as he saw Maori on his screen he was like that R
20:35
button I'd better not touch me or I'm going to die so flash down from the earlier jungle invade it was why he's
20:42
respecting it so much and Rogue did a good job to try and leverage it get as much out of it as they could and we
20:47
spent a lot of the early game praising kanabe for his passing for his decision making for the way he was playing the
20:52
game but Mal rang has come alive now making some good choices of his own utilizing the threat and the power of
20:59
this targeted ultimate against these immobile carries yeah gal's trying to get out no flash no way there comes the
21:06
buy ulti there goes the mid laner there's Larson getting the kill it's a
21:12
situation where Rogue is finding a number of picks but jdg is cross-mapping well they have pressure in the mid lane
21:17
right now oduami's making his way down and he's looking to make a play on me they see him though they see him oh
21:22
Kenobi eat a lot of the culling there using ulti to get some distance Odo won't be able to collapse in time so jdg
21:28
get out but they will not claim the second turret yeah and look at all these Wards it's all these wards that give jdg
21:34
the early alert here through the jungle and they're gonna go for another red buff steal kanavi will not stop cannavi
21:41
going in and securing that red gets him to level up to 12. the blast cone nearly seals his fate but
21:48
cops ready to go in missing in Hope trying to walk away from it [Applause]
21:54
still ready to go but he misses the piercing light on the missing bro still looking to take the fight a little bit
22:01
further but jdg are making distance you can see Mao rank coming up through the river seeing if there's an angle to cut
22:07
these guys off tier one turret Still Standing fall breaker being charged Mal
22:12
rank not gonna find a whole lot off of it here just yet shrimpy is going aggressive as there he goes three six
22:20
nine picks him up as hope and missing are stuck in the side brush hope for the nice flash now Larson's here to 1v2
22:28
missing goes down and Larson goes over the wall he's safe and he got paid to do
22:34
it what a chase this is madness Rogue over three walls and now they might be
22:39
trappeding out looking for it we're not done yet you gal's ready to finally join up in the fight Mal rang still has the
22:46
ultimate keep that one in mind three six Nine's gonna lead the way Mal rang just
22:51
backing inside the brush he is a secret agent Behind Enemy line that was
22:57
actually so big for rogue though they've almost evened up the gold and they're still ahead the two dragons these picks
23:03
for Rogue have been paying off I'm so confused that's the one I just
23:08
watched gentlemen that was a crazy series we're coming back but it's one of
23:14
those things is Rogue is typically the calm calculated team like they'll fight you but this was just blind chasing from
23:21
Rogue they were bloodthirsty for these kills and like this initial start looked horrendous although I made forced to
23:26
flash out but look at the play here from Cobb melting the back line of jdg and killing kanavi right off the bat it was
23:33
at this point that I think Road could have called it a day but no they wanted more they certainly did the bloodlust
23:38
here especially with trimby the Nami wave initially knocks up three big one for them uh and is able to get a zero
23:45
kill but then they keep going mauron over this wall trimby flashes over to try and follow him misses the bubble and
23:51
then 369 says wait a second Nami is easy to kill and they're just buying time for Lawson to get here looks like he's about
23:57
to make the play but then they realize that Talia wall is coming over so lost it's like nope I'm gonna hold them away and then I'm gonna get a kill regrew
24:03
with my team and then get out absolutely hilarious game of Red Rover jdg though
24:09
focusing back on the dragons they want to put a stop to these rope stacking exactly Rogue may have caught up in the
24:14
gold but as jdg having a catch up here in the Drakes kanavi should secure this one here with a Smite but the waves
24:21
coming in missing and Kenobi gonna get hit by that a TP shows up Rogue may have overextended may have over committed
24:27
trimby's trying to get himself away but yagal's still ready to throw another rock could not be gets the kill and
24:34
trimby goes down Rogue continues to retreat but yagao isn't done he rides the wave right on in gets a seismic
24:40
shove back onto Larson and the emperor is now the Target 3-6 now finds the play
24:47
and Rogue have lost two 369 squeezes that big gragas body through those two
24:53
walls and finds the flash play my goodness jdg Strikes Back jdg is
24:59
considered one of if not the best team fighting team in the world and you can see exactly why you can't come to a
25:07
fight half-heartedly you have to have a clear plan otherwise jdg will punish you oh boy goes over the wall looking for
25:14
trouble but trouble found him knavy's still going forward here he nearly has the collateral damage the ulti cooldown
25:20
just barely not there if kanavi has a little more time he'll get the head shot and get the kill 369 won't drop so easy
25:29
will pay with his life kanabi asserting his jungle dominance
25:35
with the two level lead here the graves is so abusive and rogue's aggression was
25:41
very quickly stopped jdg once again fine positioned on the map but Rogue their
25:47
over aggression is quickly punished and look at how quickly the gold lead is building now they felt confident after
25:53
that playing the top side but that aggression that over eagerness to force a fight around the dragon fell short and
26:00
the moment that they showed an ounce of weakness jdg was quick to get into this is what fans have come to know and love
26:07
about jdg this fearsome mid game fear throughout the world they come back such
26:13
a huge way and sweep Rogue off the map this is starting to look a little
26:19
concerning for the European fans in the audience but I said at the very beginning back in draft man it would be
26:24
quite a statement to make to come out in game one and just dunk on this game with the graves with that carry power and
26:30
it's exactly what kanabi is doing third item completed Black Cleaver he's gonna
26:36
be deadlier than ever and Rogue is gonna have to find a way to deal with this incredibly fed Graves the only person on
26:43
the map with more Farm is the enemy mid laner he has 110 CS up on his opponent in the jungle
26:50
VI might as well be a cannon minion in front of this great Brave things baby level 14 Hawk and Avi it is absolutely
26:59
crazy how powerful he is on the map right now and jdg they have their eyes set on this bound I mean when you look
27:06
at it they both have boots and three items the problem is Mal rang two of those items are a rock and a butter
27:11
knife he's not doing so hot up against the might of this fed Graves of this
27:17
level 14 jungler by the way both his solo laners are level 13. one of the enemies solo laners is level 13 again
27:23
it's only Larson's azir keeping Pace with this ah the man bought a butter knife to his shotgun fight Clayton that
27:30
is gonna be very difficult to win let's take a look at how the vision starts to close though because this is one of the
27:35
things that jdg also do really well it's those mid game team fights and then as soon as they win the fight they
27:40
completely take control of both sides of your jungle could not be moving into that Grace for another burst attempt
27:46
good Lord man the burn nearly kills him 29 HP I believe it was red buff plus
27:53
Smite showcasing the damage cannavi looking for more the ultimate from 369 goes a little wide though which means
27:58
Odom they will be safe good size set from him but you can see the Suffocation now coming in from jdg the vision being
28:05
denied the control that jdg have over the top side jungle making it harder and harder for rogue to approach but you can
28:11
see that one little Ward near the top side blue of jdg's jungle the road will
28:16
have a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqQ_orDW6Qo
blue,GEN,KARMA,EZREAL,VOLIBEAR,ORNN,VIKTOR,red,T1,CAITLYN,RYZE,LUX,NOCTURNE,[no_name],T1,"0:00
pretty well at those power spikes set up some stuns survive through those first few drake fights get to the late game
0:06
get those ornaments online and jenny's late game comp is looking fantastic just have to get there and that's going
0:12
to be pretty hard if you look at the amount of power that t1 have camille one of the few
0:19
top lane brews that can actually work tanks to do the true damage and precision protocol and the 131 of t1 is
0:26
disgusting frankly uh there is so much setup available uh there is paranoia
0:31
there is shove on bot side there is rise in the mid lane uh and there is a commute
0:38
and here we go on to the rift for game number one i didn't even realize how uh perfect
0:46
that song is by the way the lyrics i win every time every time
0:51
it uh certainly tells a story as a lot of our production has been doing so so very
0:57
well so far for this series they did win every time yeah they they're undefeated as of right now so
1:04
i wonder what is going to continue uh as mentioned previously you can go a little
1:10
bit more into the choices that have been made most notably faker we have seen a
1:15
ton of the unsealed spellbook rice being picked up has gone back to the face rush instead which
1:22
i kind of like in terms of uh possibilities of aggression especially together with owner do you think the t1
1:29
composition generally wants to uh wait a little bit until that paranoia becomes available
1:34
and immediate applause at the very first trade yeah
1:39
gotta love it the hen's gonna hit big uh on that one in the early part of this and uh you know the difference here in
1:46
these compositions to really highlight is that if t1 cannot find a lead in the
1:52
mid game as they are so famous for doing the rise will never be able to do the same amount of damage as the victor will
1:58
in the late game and you will lose wars of attrition against this ezreal that has more consistent damage output than caitlyn who's in an even game will be
2:05
able to perform with and then you're you're stuck trying to make plays with this lux who's very fairly fragile as
2:11
well okay fighting over level two the flat forward as kerry is going for it with
2:17
the queue of his own that's going to be a trade his first blood is giving over to the ezreal gummy you see able to
2:23
trade one back as our supports they were ready to fight and that's going to be a first uh kill
2:29
for both the 80 carries here favorable trade in terms of summoners for gen g but man
2:36
starting off right from the get go we saw peanut also puffing towards top side or a bot side rather uh might look for
2:43
maybe an invade or a punish on faker they don't know where he is and he might get caught off guard or if he goes
2:48
toward well that's not the brush you wanted to check here as faker just gonna die had novice in
2:54
there they had a ward in the jungle but they did not know where peanut was all right genji are starting off high speed
3:01
in this best of five here and this is a tragedy for t1's composition you start trading like this you start giving a
3:06
victor gold this early and it is a disaster the first blood going over to ruler here
3:12
flash you know expended here on the side of karius so he's a little bit more vulnerable too and so far this 2v2 going
3:18
in their favor they get that kill in the mid lane and chovey is accelerated and this is one of the angles i was thinking you
3:24
know most analysts saying okay bottom 2b2 is going to be the most important matchup but for me it's the mid jungle
3:29
skirmish where faker kit falls behind and they fall apart and we see level two hit slightly
3:35
earlier for landon ruler uh gumiyushi and carrier still go all in here
3:41
okay i think he's coming he's gonna come down i'm going in he says
3:48
nice just like that basically is what he's
3:53
saying keep doing this and uh i think it was partially because they really didn't have a good idea of
3:59
where he was i mean there was a ward on the raptors but i'm not sure how early that came in and
4:05
uh yeah he just cleared his entire jungle went red to raptors down to krugs as now kerry is looking to
4:12
poke i guess i think the read from t1 was that uh as he pulled the raptors into the brush he then moved upwards
4:17
towards his blue side skipping crocs which we see very often but instead went for a full gear bot side wasn't spotted
4:23
possibly looking to maybe assist set up a play on that bot side onto gomeshin carrier but then 2v2 happened uh and
4:31
then he was able to move back up towards that mid lane regardless is having a great time in this matchup
4:37
early as you can see on the top side yep uh it's is how it's gonna go at least doran can itemize against this from lane
4:45
he's just not giving him opportunities here to uh even get all those minion last hits but
4:51
you know in terms of how this lane state now is going to be for trovia it gives him so much power he
4:57
took first strike is going to be able to harass a lot as you can see the win rates here for 22 spring for these uh bought duos ezreal karma doing better
5:04
but now chobi is in a position where he can actually pressure faker we could actually push him out of waves and usually rises power in the early game is
5:11
actually having permaprio not going to be the case in this early game note also that owner has just been powerful and
5:16
wants to get the six as soon as humanly possible as you do on the nocturne and
5:21
just off of that lead as well as the top side that zeus has been able to find for himself uh we actually have the early gold
5:28
league from the kill already being completely negated and this has been such a consistent thing 41 where they
5:33
always always no matter the circumstances are able to get trades up in terms of gold's owner i don't i don't
5:40
know about this one peanut again it's gonna get collapsed on and faker's backing right now but with
5:45
that spell shield should be okay jovi is coming over to help poke him away but can't quite get there on time so owner
5:52
is able to squeak out of that one and genji have been a big fan of the early
5:58
drakes and expecting to see them continue doing that here but this is such an early drake that allows them to reset for the rift herald fight as well
6:05
this is the power of toby getting that first blood normally you know a lot of matchups rise just dominates the victor one can be a little bit more volatile
6:11
but you get an early kill like that you're the one pushing in the rise they find owner early deny him the ability to
6:16
shut this straight down and genji have such masterful control of this game and yes t1 with the power farming you
6:22
mentioned ketchup and gold now take a gold lead as they're so famous for but their composition needs to have a bigger
6:28
lead than this 10 minutes from now and genji are already smooth sailing and owners here again but he's got to get in
6:35
there and smite this away but he isn't quite as smart the q also gonna miss so peanut gets ahead of them on that
6:41
scuttle at least although owners still ahead on cs key thing owner's still not six that
6:47
first paranoia is a really big one need to try to set up a successful play can of course go for top side where zeus has the expect ultimatum
6:54
but if doran has the wave shoving into him right so he can just set up shop in front of his turret and diving in on
7:00
is generally unadvisable especially doran seeing what he does with those and it's a caramel lane bottom doran has
7:06
just been playing almost from a weak side in the last few series that genji have played and once again he's gonna sit back and take that pressure as you
7:12
can see see that this is also kind of a relic of this season um victor is very popular early
7:18
that was uh very much a early of spring record as i'm very glad
7:23
you did point out we saw a lot of rise versus victor rise was not winning a lot of games against anyone
7:28
uh but either way yes curious gonna flash in for the poke and the trap not quite enough to land onto the hands
7:35
there and he will get out of there alive as a huge true shot barrage hits both of them i really appreciate the idea right
7:41
before harold here but unfortunately not going to work out for carrier both summoners down now unfortunately for
7:46
this critical fight and it's not even really a trade up here in any way and ruler wasn't even there
7:51
to actually punish like it was a good idea because of rulers positioning but doesn't end up working out here now down
7:57
flash before what is going to be and has been historically t1's most important objective and with peanut continuously
8:03
playing aggressive being allowed by the prior that he has in mid and bot we actually see that because they're aware of owner because they generally know
8:09
which half of the map he is he hasn't been able to find a paranoia play but also ruler and hence can actually push
8:15
up that far and be fine and now we are going into this first fight for
8:20
the herald possibly with everyone being on relative parity goal that even this
8:27
is really really tough they have two global ultimates to use to close the gap here no flash for carrier
8:34
yeah they already have this pretty low as we stand and they're going up against an or let's see if t1 can do anything as
8:40
the hornhorn will come through as a big knock up now from dorne on the top side
8:45
but you can see the rest is nt this is going to leave doran to die they say nope we're not going to be able to help
8:50
you here and so gen z do get the kill on the rift herald but they cannot pick up the eye and t1 take the fight great
8:57
fight here from t1 utilizing their ultimates as they all come online here and this is the type of fight that t1
9:03
always takes on harold and genji yes they got a pretty explosive start to this game had a great early game but the
9:08
composition still isn't quite online yet to hold on to that rip trail so tightly davis is really playing with fire but
9:15
actually a good calculation knows that he should be relatively safe although will he calculate that peanut is up here
9:21
to help out doesn't look like uh peanut can get there on time uneven with the boiler barrel when
9:27
peanut hasn't backed in quite a while still sitting on any coal fields and don't want to take that risk and i
9:34
thought that the setup was definitely a possibility even crucially that paranoia makes it so hard for genji to actually
9:40
coordinate in this fight and i i uh i'm pretty sure that's a big reason we see doran going very aggressively the rest
9:46
of his team they literally don't know right you can't see t1 yeah they're not able to actually
9:51
know if that ultimate lands can we follow up because of that you won't get the early uh fight win there and guma
9:58
even with that first block going off to ruler uh is getting more and more fed now a lot of paranoia users you know a
10:05
lot of nocturnes would actually go on to the backline carries there but that's what gen d was hoping for in that choke
10:11
point oh they're going to dive deep and hope they just go on the door and collapse and cut the team in half and yeah really hard to communicate in
10:16
situations like this that's the part part of the power paranoia it's not just shutting down side lanes and getting on top of the back line it's just straight
10:23
up blinding your enemy team yeah and it matters too for the composition of t1 because if they had you know like uh
10:29
i don't know a hecarim or effects alongside of this then maybe you could dive in as a team but owner has
10:35
identified that at this point okay i'm just here you know throw it down i'm not really gonna dive in my team can't
10:40
follow up that well especially not yet especially before camille uh doesn't even have an item that's the main thing
10:46
zeus later on i'm sure he'd be happy to join his old pal owner for uh dive into the enemy back line camille one of the
10:53
very few top lane is that can reliably lock down a slippery pick laggy asriel but for now that is not going to be the
11:00
case just yet but it's again that coordination that works out really well for t1 and
11:06
coming into today we were expecting zayus to have an edge in the matchup and uh yes
11:11
it was a blank from as he's going in for this one i don't think he's got a queue up in time
11:18
to really chunk it down so that's hex ultimatum gone uh right before some teleports are up
11:23
but of course three minutes or so until the unleashed teleport is available critically if genji get a two-drake
11:29
advantage with this composition they could just sit back and wait it's going to give them such a huge edge especially because it's going to be a critical
11:34
drake either mountain hextech or infernal here so very important for t1 to actually deny
11:40
this fight right now then diaz of course teleport coming online just now but it's leash so it
11:46
won't be able to actually come in at the last possible second doesn't have ultimates this is essentially a 4v4 and
11:51
with the vision being taken by t1 in the river and prio in bot side fake and also
11:57
getting into mid uh it's really hard for genji to actually contest this they have to walk into the poke of
12:02
guma of carrier and if they slightly over extend immediately owner will pull the trigger
12:07
faker can run up in so if t1 won it they could keep that hold tight uh but it looks like instead
12:14
they're gonna choose to give this one up and yeah i can see the logic behind it not enough
12:21
yeah yeah but they also instead get more control on the top side of the map i don't know if that's uh
12:28
that's a great trait especially with infernal rift on the map yeah and it's top side for a rip trail that spawns in two minutes and
12:34
its second rift plates are going to be gone not that critical root connects yep
12:39
no follow up on that one guma not quite close enough and uh yeah definitely a choice that 2-1 decided to make you know
12:47
as instead they are going to try to highlight this top side as here comes the paranoia in three on one and doran
12:53
does not have any hope as faker will eat a lot of those turret shots as well owner but the kill is still there it's a
12:59
faster ornhorn maybe you turn this one around one of the most difficult champions in league of legends to dive
13:05
is the orange but it's a very late horn coming out from doran wait so last popsicle second with the flash and as a result we'll go down so t1 do
13:12
not give the streak up for free but i think the two drake lead is much more valuable here between the hookshot and
13:17
faker's instant root it's so hard for the owen as well to actually find the second activation on the ultimate
13:22
and peanut he gets played ultimatum is available now and peanut
13:30
yeah you're not gonna be able to look out of this one don't believe that karma will help either against this much lockdown we just saw these three in the
13:37
top side and they do it again to the bear lots of greed here from peanut grabs a plate but we'll give
13:43
over a lot more gold to t1 really keeping them in a lead in terms of that gold advantage right now because four
13:49
kills to two and a 900 gold lead yeah it looks great now at 14 minutes as plates fall off but in 10 minutes time you're
13:55
gonna need a bigger one than that at least this dive is successful as you mentioned there's so many ways to shut down the second activation he has no
14:01
chance here to pull that one off but the two drake lead is what i'm really most
14:06
concerned about because now genji can just avoid taking fights and again uh there is no vision coverage
14:13
um on top side the investor teleport as well and genji one play is it's not gonna be a
14:19
breaking point for you like you can you can let them have that it's fine you don't need to get to play you have owned
14:25
victor and ezreal i think you'll be fine without the extra gold that you get from that a bit of a lapse of judgment for
14:31
sure especially with the lack of vision but uh yeah i mean you know t1 is a team that loves to push their early leads and
14:37
get a lot of plates and scuffer dives and stuff like that genjir is a team that loves to pick up the dragons and
14:44
get that for their advantage so maybe in the back peanuts line he's like well we're doing really well but i want to get a little bit extra and get one of
14:50
these plates as well but uh definitely a little bit of a mistake as we return here to the game interestingly even with
14:57
champions that generally have extremely high priority uh the lux and the karma or the lux and decade rather uh the rise
15:05
and the camille no plates were actually picked up by t1 and that's not something that happens and it does tie into the overall laning strength which is the one
15:12
thing where i think gen g has just been almost unmatched in the entirety of the lck uh it's more about what happens as soon
15:19
as these turrets start to fall when the map starts to open up that's where i get more worried about this diving who now zeus went a bit far
15:26
thinking he had owner on the back up of the gank as flash comes in and toby will take down the camille bloody game here
15:34
in game number one of this series is t1 are going to try to damage this mid turret but won't be able to get any
15:40
permit damage i say that the cannon wave that's going to be first turret blood
15:45
over to the side of ruler solo down in the bottom side so at the end of the day gen d gonna take a gold lead and enjoy
15:52
this very much yeah they're going to take zeus off the map as well costing him some critical farm you can see that's denied there on the top side of
15:57
the map and you know right now he has a massive lead because in the early game camille will crush the orn but over
16:02
extensions like this you cannot afford and the idea you could see the ping on nocturne is i'm going to actually collapse we're going to
16:09
end up winning this exchange but toby's here they don't calculate this the timing is also very poor zeus does end
16:15
up getting flashed on here by chobi 300 gold goes over they with this prior and the knowledge that nocturne is top get
16:20
first turret bottom side and you can't be trading objectives like this as t1 with your opponent's composition being
16:26
much stronger in the late game in addition to that jovi getting more gold is so big for the composition of genji
16:31
even though he's going for a low damage build as we've seen joe view in the past uh please know lich bane trophy i i
16:38
still remember that that one no morellos uh the jokes aside
16:44
ever frost has a lot of value into a large part of t1's composition which is that top half all very short range gonna
16:50
be forced to go into what is going to be a monstrously monstrously fed victor with gathering
16:57
storm uh and in a late game for t1 the margins becomes less and less and unless they're
17:03
able to utilize kumiyushi very well and crucially pick up this drake t1 it's looking kind of rough here in
17:08
game number one because saw point with inferno against genji's composition
17:14
that's not great that's what i was going back to earlier when we were talking about them leaving the drake up because it was
17:19
going to be a relevant one no matter what with ocean clouds start here as it's spawning now genji do not have to
17:25
fight this but they've got a little bit of control over the bottom side yeah and given their current position
17:31
they are clearing out all this vision they absolutely could decide to go for it peanut leading the charge on this and
17:36
baker just now teleporting note the flank coming in from the side of t1 they've got a camille and a rise behind
17:43
him and has to be so careful they're grouping up to check okay they seize and they're looking for
17:49
the turn the flash in on to faker and he will be rooted down and taken down as
17:55
well but t1 say that's okay we'll take the drake dave's though also going to be taken down here so gen g pick up a
18:02
couple of kills but t1 do get the three this is what you this is the the affording that you have when you have a
18:07
two drake lead you don't actually need to win the drake but if you win the fight you get the goal which is more valuable because all all time is on your
18:14
side and this is a character uncharacteristic rather mistaken coordination zeus goes over the wall
18:20
retreats faker is still going in t1 is completely split while they're holding the drape venup might lose his fight
18:26
with the grump respawn time but the goal that was gone into the pockets of gen d there again really really big and yeah
18:33
you don't get soul point but you're still able to get so far into the amount of scaling you might have a play here oh
18:40
not the teleport i was expecting they call it off you can continue crying well i mean that was the point right
18:46
scaling good there you go now the genji uh i'm loving the setup from genji here
18:52
the amount of vision control that they have combined with the fact that faker has no flash
18:57
means that him and zeus are basically caught in no man's land there's no one to help them the hard engage is more than enough and
19:04
once this death ball really stands and you don't find backline axes there's not that much for you to do once
19:10
the fight actually starts for t1 and it's uneven footing looks way harder this is a question we
19:16
had for tm1 when they faced gen g at full strength for the first time maybe you know we were speculating many were
19:22
would this be the first time t1 has a real disadvantage in a series like this this season in a like a real high
19:28
profile series not just the best of three when they're going for the perfect record but in the finals right and in
19:33
this game they're only 300 gold behind but the composition is screaming massive advantages here for genji and t1 they
19:40
needed to have a bigger lead they needed to be able to hit genji when they were brittle but as you mentioned the death ball is coming strong oh the root comes
19:47
in and in fact doran will not be able to respond to that lasting a little bit longer than he thought that was in
19:53
ezreal with the red buff and flash so if faker overstood his welcome he would have been dead only he had no threats
20:00
would have been able to hit him uh and the one thing 41 that that is important
20:06
to still keep in mind is that this compound is over extension no this is the side lane play that we expect and
20:12
stopwatch is good but it ain't that good that's going to be the kill given over to gumiuci as i finish my sentence t1
20:19
comp is still incredibly good at punishing mispositions from anyone between zeus owner and faker if someone
20:25
is pushing in a side lane even just a little bit too far up as we see here you can immediately get taken down the kill
20:31
goes over to guma as well and guma being fed is so much more safe brings so much more longevity than the
20:37
rest of t1 because barring za is owner and faker at this point getting kills doesn't really provide you with that
20:43
much but guma remaining fat means that no matter what if he can survive in late game team fights he can still carry yeah
20:49
maybe he has to be him right and this is why i wondered you know in the draft would we maybe see the crown of the
20:55
shattered queen on chovy because it might not have saved him in this case but would have had a much higher health
21:00
bar when that stopwatch goes off maybe they turn it either way you know in this composition he cannot really farm which
21:07
is why it was so critical for him to actually get ahead as he did early see in the side lane even in the safe
21:12
side lane where he's not even past the halfway point you're very vulnerable as the victor here
21:17
and the key thing is with t1 keeping genji on their toes it's exactly what we
21:22
expected which is t1 have suffered more in this game than they have in many a laning phase which
21:28
in of itself is a huge testament to how good genji is playing but it's when the map opens up that t1 has consistent
21:34
their consistency really shines through that's why they're undefeated it's not because they always win every single lane it's because they're able to find
21:40
the game-winning place and even though genji's competition skills amazingly that remains a viable
21:45
threat yeah it's really true and i think 21 are going to show a lot more of that you know regardless of
21:52
the current state of the game or the compositions they will be looking for plays and they might just get peanut
21:57
here as he will have to alt away just to survive and with the drake coming up here in a minute will he have
22:04
that ready i'm not so sure is now t1 have position around this river he's gonna have to back here as well took way
22:10
too much damage there and this means t1 as you say we'll have prior look at the control wards placed around this drake pit there's nothing they don't know
22:16
there's even one here in the mid lane guaranteeing that there's no flank angle genji can take and this is t1 which is
22:23
so harrowing they're punished plays even when their composition is starting to fall behind they will punish peanut now
22:28
a second time over extending on to their setup vision and the setup for this fight is incredibly important because if
22:34
genji gets it they're on sore points they're looking incredible see one can start stacking drakes then the scaling
22:40
conversation really changes as well because the amount of damage that zeus and guma are going to do is not really fair uh i want to do a
22:46
quick fail the stopwatch check because there has actually been picked up multiple in anticipation of this fight
22:52
which again whoever wins this has a really good position from here oh no the flash but
22:57
that is going to be ruler with the quick cleanse as he does have to use that though before this goes off and alcario
23:03
with no flash for his own engages gen z stalwart here in the river trying to put
23:10
up a wall and avoid it sage goes over the wall just leading the charge ready
23:15
to fight broke point control but shovey wasn't here so he can't actually get that death ray damage through t1 will actually spill into the other side now
23:22
they've got to be wary of the zeus flank once again all right setting up uh another kind of
23:28
wall here we got traps coming out from guinea you see and you do not want to get headshot by this caitlyn right now
23:33
as they use over the wall they're looking for trophy he doesn't have his stomachs anymore but the damage from the
23:39
backside of density is gigantic they're able to take down both of the divers on
23:44
the side of t1 but that it's going to be the dragon going the way of t1 so a
23:50
crazy fight but you won't get another inferno insanely well played from genji that
23:55
doran zoning off the entire back half off t1 now as the divers go in there's no follow-up but the drake still goes to
24:01
t1 so now gen g they need to push for this battery yeah we're gonna push for it as fast as they can they've got a ton of damage here
24:07
and you know with t1 having this ward here it's so valuable they know exactly where to run relmorp is available for
24:12
faker we've seen those in some lck finals recently here we go are they going to contest i think they
24:17
have to are they just going to really morph into this one i don't know as okay they're going to go on the back
24:24
side here they want to take a fight and defeat healy a headshot from kuma that's going to be one kill just he gets the
24:31
baron but they get nothing else as t1 are on the chase faker leading the charge he's gonna get that bounce onto
24:37
both of them and at least toby will go down as they are looking for more a triple kill now for guma and that is
24:44
going to be the ace into the hands of cy indeed this first game have been both extremely proactive but also greedy in
24:52
the objective takes like this you know we've seen so many times peanut getting caught when he grabbed that first plate
24:58
dies immediately afterwards clearing vision around the drake gets picked a second time and in these fights here
25:04
where you're trying to rush down drake you have to be wary of t1's ability to turn on a dime using this realm warp and
25:10
if you don't have that ward removed if you don't have vision control maybe your best option is to back away because t1
25:15
will come over here and punish now 4 000 gold the lead they are poised to actually potentially take this game the
25:21
scaling argument you mentioned it earlier because it is infernal souls now or infernal drake's there now stacking
25:27
is not necessarily a one-sided conversation and while this looks like it's not working out with the immediate
25:34
lockdown of the enemy back line carrier good musician faker can't join this fight at all it's still a success
25:40
because peanut is dealing with zeus peanut flashes crucially if he is a split second earlier and he's actually
25:46
able to get that drake this sequence might not have happened but instead they feel the pressure they lose their soul
25:53
points and they're like we got to do something we got to do something they over extend into this everyone gets
25:58
taken down and it's exactly these type of decisive swingy plays that t1 have
26:03
shown us so many times throughout the entirety of the split it's t1's composition the ability to collapse
26:09
quickly you have a real morph and knows where he placed it was behind gen d it was how they i'm gonna stop this
26:14
baroness nobody gets out alive nobody survives at the end of this scene baker has learned in his uh many years of her
26:21
eyes uh has had some really good real marks and some not so good ones so that one definitely goes into
26:27
one of the really good ones i do have to agree um because if you real more right on top of them there you probably just all die
26:34
anyway so just a really nice response from t1 they knew immediately that was going to happen and they get there just on time
26:40
also know the itemization from both zeus and owner um their job is just to create
26:45
space for guma that's it uh they both went for extremely early guardian angels we already saw zeus prox
26:52
in the previous fight we see owner now have it as well and the amount of time that they buy means that guma can get
26:57
off more orders more orders more autos and when he is um close to an infinity
27:02
edge and 7-0 uh at 27 minutes pretty good feels like it's working out
27:08
pretty well i think i think it's a better strategy i think it's an okay
27:19
of course gameplay there's the volleyball but he's not gonna at this stage of the game be able to survive long enough to actually get
27:24
on top of this caitlyn so kumbhusi is basically immortal in these fights if the front line does its job the lights
27:30
are turned off and so he's become so out of control now that gen g can't just go well we pick the gate when we win the
27:36
fight you're gonna have to somehow still win this front to back with all those extra threats so positioning becomes so key vision setup which they have not had
27:43
control of this entire game even when they had leads is just such a big problem is you're
27:48
never able to even slightly look at where trophy's got the wave that actually blocked all the damage
27:54
that was kind of insane uh karma you know she does some cool things but yeah i think it's a really good point you
27:59
know we always talk about you know how bolivar is one of those uh quote unquote tanks not necessarily having a lot of
28:06
those tank steroids and human divine thunder as well to start off so he's not even full tank so you know he's not
28:12
jumping in he'll be looking to defensively peel and maybe if the fight is going their way he can do something
28:18
look at the trap placement and even the the e coming out from carrier they're like you're not coming in here you're not contesting vision you are not going
28:24
to have fio they denied any sort of idea that is a running incredibly fast fair i
28:31
don't know what that guy's on but zayn's is not getting away as okay he's trading back actually trying to get the kill
28:37
under the hand sent to flash but not quite enough nt1 start the drake fast enough now that this pick actually is
28:43
committed to because gender on the wrong side of the map here drake spawns right now and they've got fast track to it
28:49
gently needs a sprint over here ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WnF6lKmjYM
blue,GEN,DORAN,PEANUT,CHOVY,RULER,LEHENDS,red,DK,NUGURI,CANYON,SHOWMAKER,DEOKDAM,KELLIN,GEN,"0:00
absolutely I mean Dom wanna you feel like on red side has to be you gotta Genji is never going to be the ones to
0:05
ban it if they don't it would be very interesting because it would speak to the fact that Dom one has a plan right and that that's what we're really
0:11
looking for here a clear Direction on where your prep is taking us the fact that they're taking this long really
0:16
does lead me to believe the umi's not going to be banned of course it could just be a last second pivot here but
0:21
what's it going to be so Yumi is going to come through uh like
0:27
McDonald's has been thrown yeah lahenz is the best Yumi in the world in my opinion he's the one that showed
0:32
everyone how to play it okay and there it is I want to know is there going to be a
0:39
mordekaiser is there going to be a cinch is there going to be some sort of spicy counterpick here they do they have
0:45
um they got a note they for sure knew that you were giving over Yumi I think that this is actually a great Gauntlet
0:51
to throw in a game number one though you leave things up you experiment in a game one and then if you realize that well
0:57
there's no way that we can deal with this that's when you pivot in game number two oh it will be the Nami locked
1:02
in and there is uh the luchinami bottom Lane pretty standard here drum and Kellen have very much enjoyed it played
1:08
it against Genji a lot this year I love Lucian Army but I this is a really big risk being taken by Domo Kia I was
1:14
completely with you zail I was reading this as domon has a specific answer even with how good luchinami name Lanes have
1:21
been the fact that Dr mankallen say it doesn't matter even if they go for the silver Yumi we can win the lane hard
1:28
enough that the yumi's not gonna matter but I find it hard to imagine okay yeah me too so it's going to be MF so this is
1:35
actually really really interesting so which which is which is going to win here the Unstoppable force of the
1:40
immovable object The Undefeated Yumi or the windless MF which one really has
1:45
more power well we haven't actually seen Umi pad up with anything other than civil tournament as showmakers hovering
1:53
the Zoe but he's not oh and we were almost treated so that's one
1:59
of the things that I think have not has not really been explored is trying to outrange Yumi and making use of the
2:05
advantage that you can have with uh with picks like the Zoe or the Jace but instead the monkey is going to put again
2:11
show make on a facilitating mid and now as Genji I think you're looking to ban out Kerry junglers make sure that Canyon
2:18
doesn't get something that he can find a big lead on and then Snowball the game yeah absolutely especially as you say
2:23
you know when we have the lissandra here for them indicator you know one of these two guys is almost always going to be on the carry you know I am interested
2:30
though there are still options to try to answer the Umi like as I said mordekaiser was one that we had seen uh
2:36
you know in some of the other leagues around the world people would even just bring it in top it doesn't necessarily have to be a bot Lane answer because in
2:41
any big fight you can just all whoever the umiz attached to Yumi pops off you lock her down try to burst her out um so
2:47
I am still curious to see if that is gonna be an option if one of the problems with that is we don't really play very good
2:52
mordekaiser in the lck I think that's uh that's that's an impact thing he's extraordinarily good at that champion but we don't necessarily find as much
3:00
success with the pick uh over in Korea so we'll see whether nagri is going to like do it or doran's going to do it uh
3:07
because of course both of them have tried they just haven't necessarily succeeded as Camille is going to go away
3:12
I'm also really interested to see if Genji's gonna draft any more lockdown for the MF because one of the things that we've really seen with EMF is that
3:19
they're struggling to actually get effective ultimates right there is going to be a lot of dive here already with those Sandra bending out the Camille I
3:24
think makes a tremendous amount of sense it's a great pick for an ugly and it's also something that can dive backline you do want that dime buddy to follow up
3:31
with the lissandra and you want to deny access to that MF because the MF really needs someone to lock them someone in place and then stand and fire with that
3:38
ultimate and what's interesting to me is that Genji's metal rate seems very similar to DRX DRX was the only team
3:43
that even later in the tournament we stole still prioritized The Misfortune even though I think we were generally in
3:49
agreement that the pick hasn't abysmal win raid how hasn't looked that good and I can see the Synergy between the Yumi
3:56
and the MF right the amount of poke that you have available the movement Speed Works really really well but overall I I
4:02
do think that even with the amount that I'm not the biggest fan of Donald overall would have known this has
4:07
happened and the gragas and a lissandra into a immobile 80 carry is a threatening combination yeah I really
4:13
really like Greg as a Top Lane pick here you know theoretically could be Flex the jungle you know if they really want to try to mix things up but I am going to
4:20
be assuming it's going over in the Top Lane uh the gragas ultimate is just another one of those things that makes it very very difficult for the MF to get
4:27
that full ultimate that you really are looking for in these fights you can split up the fight you can even disengage that MF and try to focus down
4:33
the front line so a lot of options here yep certainly something that nagori is very very good at as well his gragas has
4:39
been fantastic as that is Renekton locked in into it not a huge fan personally how we feeling gentlemen
4:44
that's that's the self-counter pick uh what we see here for Doran and now I think in terms of laning phase we have
4:49
seen that gragas especially with grass does exceptionally well into the Renekton my core is that Genji says we
4:55
need to have an early pressure point on the map and I do think in terms of Prior and early skirmishes Renekton maokai has
5:01
incredible skirmishing power this is death ball oh what's up
5:07
okay Toby rise this is not a pick I've been expecting to see at all most mid-layers I talk to think rise is
5:14
literally in the dumpster that this pick is is you know out of the meta completely it's also relatively short range against powerful engage here from
5:20
the gragas M from the Sandra so Toby's gonna have to play this very very well but it does give them the ability to Side Lane it gives them the ability
5:43
everyone this is just kind of what happens this is amazing I mean they obviously needed an 80 jungler you don't
5:48
want to go Triple AP top side but I was expecting some of the lines lines of a kindred yeah or maybe even like an Olaf
5:54
but the cane here is gonna be incredibly exciting and to me so much of the cane
5:59
depends on your early game how quickly can you actually get the transform when you're against a maokai jungle I do like
6:04
this pick especially because when you're against tank junglers as the cane you can invade heavily and scrap with them
6:10
non-stop to really Farm those souls to get an early transform and if you can get an early transform on Canyon this is
6:16
one of those power farming junglers that really can take over the game it feels like it fits his style conceptually I
6:22
love it by lahenz what an absurd start to this series and here we are on to Summoners rip
6:28
is going to be so exciting I will say there is an enormous amount of CC here
6:34
on the Genji side to get lockdown for rulers ultimates right everyone else on
6:39
the team here has roots has cc to try to get that ideal ulti in uh domon looking
6:44
for something a little bit sneaky here and also with the relative lack of range of both these compositions whoever oh he
6:52
doesn't know I think he I think he's just gonna start enemy wolves he's actually looking just
6:58
for a level and start because based on the minimap no one else is actually moving over here to a system right you know we've we've got gragas chilling up
7:04
top we have these guys showing they're trying to to not give this away so I think it is just going to be a wool
7:09
start for canyon look at the paffing Ping as well oh peanut might spot it unless he's going he's going broadside
7:15
he's going to start probably Rafters oh my God they don't know I mean I think this is a really great read Because
7:20
Malco a lot of time will actually do these Raptor starts that is my guess is that he's saying okay you're playing
7:25
maokai if you're gonna start leashless it's likely on Raptors I'm gonna do wolves and I'm gonna power Farm your top
7:31
side without you even having any idea this was risky but he sneaks in and secret agent Canyon here gonna be
7:39
stealing away multiple camps and already accelerating the pace of the game and this is so reminiscent of every time
7:44
that Domin have found the operand against Genji it's been moments like this but peanut might be suspecting
7:49
something is up but he can even scrap him here this is even better if he actually takes a scrap and actually gets
7:55
towards that form even faster he doesn't know he doesn't my goodness peanut he's noticed
8:03
it come on over there's this mic from Ken he's looking for even more down to 200 but Canyon if he just takes away the
8:10
entire top side of the Jungle he's still pretty happy but still he's going to give it up not going to push too far
8:16
look at the prior though yeah he's got it back off but this is perfect he already took two camps away right now he can just go Raptors he can go Raptors
8:23
down to his butt side if he's worried about a counter evade but like he can even do Raptors red he can go anywhere
8:28
on the map from that he's already taken two camps away from the enemy jungle he's gotten a little way towards his transform this is a brilliant level one
8:36
here from Canyon it also refers to what you were saying earlier with Kane you want to try especially I think into the
8:41
renex and into the maokai fight with them early on get as many orbs as you can and Rush towards that form overall
8:47
though when we look at the rest of the map and I think the reason why Kenyan couldn't really continue to keep going
8:53
is that as I think expected both of his solo Lanes did get pushed out yeah absolutely Doran was even cheating down
9:00
you know exactly could move down so you wouldn't want to stay around and actually fight for the death or anything but as we can see Canyon very far ahead
9:07
in the farm here already gonna be a very quick level four and he is going to be looking for red Kane almost guaranteed
9:13
he's playing conqueror so he's gonna be trying to scrap with that maokai at every single opportunity he's going to
9:18
be trying to meet him at scuttless if he contested here heavily they don't
9:23
want to let him push it in Doran the slow is going to come through there's the bunny slam flash notary gonna give
9:29
it ticket set up and they're punished oh Canyon
9:35
didn't want to commit the flash there he is punished for greeting it out that was an easy flash W for a kill there he
9:41
thought he could get him on the flash with his W didn't quite have the range does miss out on what should have been a
9:47
guaranteed First Blood I feel but remember everyone now that we've got a slight Lull in the action make sure to
9:53
grab the exclusive very nice NASA's much well emote from Prime gaming by connecting your League of Legends
9:58
account with your Prime account I think we're lucky that we managed to get that in there you have to be perfectly honest because this game seems to have
10:04
everything to talk about all the time what it also means is if Kenya not using his flashlight though he's gonna still
10:09
be very forward still get the wolf camp at the very least thanks to the priority he hasn't made on both side peanut is
10:15
able to stay remotely relevant picks up the blue buff and it kind of alleviates the damages Canyon was able to do
10:21
especially because if he does get the kill and get more orbs it's a hugeot
10:26
absolutely but the problem is he has the respawn timers right he's on he's on back here towards the Grom he already
10:33
took away the wolves and now peanut knows the problem was he did the blue buff but he was just waiting around because they didn't have information on
10:39
where Canyon was so if Canyon had actually based or ran straight down towards bot peanut could theoretically die here right so that is why he was
10:46
waiting so long to go in uh and Canon is just being as efficient as possible he's gotten multiple wolves clears he's on
10:52
his second Raptors clear here already and he's really going to be accelerating the farm and gonna have an incredible early base you know he's got a good 1200
10:59
gold in Pocket it is too bad he missed out on that first blood but there's still opportunities to return up towards
11:04
that Top Lane especially once nugury hits level six there's gonna be such good gank assist
11:09
cool and I'm looking at both teams here because in terms of setup around objectives a single messed up Canyon
11:16
hasn't back yet he's going back up top again all right well if in doubt just do it again guys as uh no flash on this one
11:23
there's the blades reach and Canyon realizes he can't turretive he can't turn dive but again this is okay he's
11:30
just going there to farm towards his form this may look like a silly gank but you don't need to always kill them this
11:35
one I would say was an effective gank the last one was a bit of an Upsy this one I'm gonna give him is they just
11:40
don't have the damage to actually finish him off but every time you can have an efficient gank like this you see ghostop
11:45
and then it's right back to his krugs and as long as nogory stays safe here you are just laughing you also see
11:51
Peanut covering right because I I wouldn't be surprised if Doran is calling hey guys I I don't have the vision maybe he's coming over again not
11:57
gonna be the case peanut he's gonna get spotted Canyon isn't it back in there there's the flash twist in advance he
12:04
throws out the barrel to get rid of the rise but there are so many problems the body slam is pretty good but still it's
12:10
gonna be first blood and it's delivered to choby and show the comes a big we
12:16
have not seen this rise it's been a pick that nothing justifiably so has fallen down the ladder Nerf time after time for
12:24
its immense impact but show me a guy literally known for just being in Lane
12:29
finds the first Blood I mean it's a great role alleviating the pressure there on the door and getting this kill
12:35
onto chobi is going to be great things for Genji here early on and then you can see they've already taken a good 8 900
12:42
gold lead here off of that one kill yeah nugury also didn't have his teleport
12:48
available so it means that Doran is much further ahead being able to deny waves Farm behind the turret gets a really
12:54
nice back here as dominant looking to head towards that top side top crab is probably all they're going to be able to
13:00
claim for now as Rift Herald is going to be spawning in a minute but let's check out this one one more time is trophy walking up the river kind of perfect
13:06
timing here I mean it's just it's just a great room right flash resident fans that guarantees there's no way out they
13:11
no no he has no flash so as long as they stay off on top of him there's no way out with the body slam so that's really
13:17
all Peanut's job is after that initial Twisted Advance just walk along with this gragas make sure he doesn't have a
13:22
freeway out and the one counter play that showmaker was able to find was just getting a plate has the demolished proc is able to get that but that's never
13:29
really going to amount to much because if Genji is able to again snowball with a composition with as much she see and
13:35
upfront damage I think it becomes very very tough do want to say that because we haven't really talked that much about
13:40
scaling yet I think it's actually very interesting because obviously Yumi is incredibly strong as Canyon goes in yeah
13:47
Toby is right here though blades reach comes through his Canyon put in the Rune prison for a moon and oh my just walks
13:53
on in their Shoemaker he'll turn Thorns coming down but they'll be able to get the first kill on defense fighting this
13:59
out as Canyons gonna have to flash green comes on through nuggery finds chothy in the back line Doran is just fighting
14:06
against show maker though as its fights on multiple fronts and doran's the one that's going to win this one chovi
14:11
eventually having to flash as he's respecting nogory who just got his back and look at Canyon doesn't Max
14:16
efficiency rates of the herald but this might be spotted nugury has to kind of play a little bit of distraction here I
14:22
don't know if they can finish this he does have a Smite available he's gonna have to Smite for help this is gonna be a bit awkward peanuts coming out of Base
14:27
still has his ultimate though uses the healing goes into the wall yeah Doran gonna come on over here just trying to
14:33
keep him busy for the moment body slam comes in Canyon locks it down the Nature's grass comes through though he's
14:40
going to deny it is now Doran getting himself
14:45
will secure the kill just barely they're able to lock him down meanwhile on the
14:51
bottom side of the map here it is the final bullet into the back of doctor but he flashes away
14:57
I've seen game one here absolute Madness they're scrapping it up across the map
15:03
and now peanut on the invade and overall I'd say for Canyon that's a successful Heist go in get blue buff and he gets
15:11
away with the rift Herald but overall it's still Genji that gets the better trades yeah absolutely Genji you know
15:17
coming up with these kills getting Summoners off bot they're looking for the dive here now yep tidal wave coming on three here is Kellen just burning
15:24
down rule up through trophy just wants to come through and grab himself some uh some fish and he
15:31
does secure Canyon is of course here as well
15:36
the blades reach comes down and shovey will be taken out someone I present to
15:42
you Genji versus Dom Juan Kia these two teams are so evenly matched as across
15:49
the map plays just continuously found by both of them in the end Genji's ahead but Donald is still able
15:57
to find I think a lot of crucial kills to get themselves in it yeah and the biggest thing to me is I'm so curious
16:03
how close Canyon is getting towards transform because there's been so much scrapping in this game to me free free
16:10
transform Kane is like half a champion but when you transform you're a champion and a half that power Spike can be so
16:16
massive if he can find the correct fights especially against these multiple melee scraps on the top side uh it is
16:22
gonna be huge yeah certainly pretty clear that uh there we go let's be heading towards that top side as there's
16:27
Gore Drinker completed and he transforms oh he has he's already through there he is
16:33
Nature's graspier towards the bottom side of the map gentlemen and Dot Tom is in so much trouble he gets smashed back
16:40
by the brambles and peanut helps claim one for ruler and this is what we talked about in terms of CC there is so much
16:46
lockdown on Genji and Del mokia is unable to deal with this and now we haven't already talked about bot Lane
16:52
that much but this Yumi MF bot Lane is absolutely demolishing because while
16:57
Domo was getting wins on the top half of the map but Lane is bleeding absolutely it's a massacre down there at this point
17:03
you know you you get those kills you push them back multiple times here drum earlier had to take a bad base you know
17:09
Jovi comes down now they get another gank in there from peanut they're gonna be able to take the first dragon they've taken multiple plates and it's plus 30
17:16
CS massive goal difference but they are looking for Joe there's the Frozen tomb Toby's Gonna Get Knocked Up the blades
17:21
reach as well now has that added CC goes golden but that is just going to buy a few seconds and not delay the inevitable
17:28
enough as now they're going to be able to hopefully take down this turret but no teleport to come through can they
17:33
actually get this off in time yes yeah the tower very tanky here on that last plate and Dorian just gonna
17:40
pop ulti here to try to clear it out Canyon though really really strong I mean he got about a 10 30 transform and
17:45
his Gore Drinker completed so he just wants to fight constantly his job now is find this maokai scrap and just don't
17:53
stop try to really limit speed of this Effectiveness here and as much flakka storing I think justifiably so is hold
17:59
up yeah Doran might be in a bit of trouble here and indeed he is there's the umbral trespass to come out he does
18:06
manage to slice his way over in Canyon gonna be interrupted by Peanut the Bramble smash is fantastic as well as
18:11
Now Toby comes in but it's a double knock-up Killen turns up oh doggere just securing it and now another bubble
18:30
but he's walking the wrong direction gentlemen some Alcove gaming may need to
18:36
come in and there's no safety here there is a turret so he's definitely going to die there it is double up secures it but
18:41
look at mid lane right there just non-stop pushing here and Kaden again is just invading he wants to scrap these
18:47
melee Champions the rest of the game because with what has happened on top side Genji who were right one and a half
18:53
kick all behind are oh sorry ahead are now behind domon Kia domonkia with the
18:58
first turbot and the skirmishes that they found on top side that Genji opted into actually have now swung back to
19:05
Gold lead
19:11
I'm trying but it's so hard to keep up with this game because everyone is fighting everywhere all of the time and
19:17
we can see the lopsidedness with Genji pulling ahead so far in both side but then domon Kia with this cane pick
19:24
coming up huge absolutely and I think Canyon's playing incredibly smart right he just has to maximize efficiency and
19:29
honestly he doesn't really want to fight ruler Orleans until it's it's overwhelming amounts of power he just
19:35
wants to be tracking peanut scrapping against Fina and Dora non-stop here with this conqueror red form Kane here early
19:41
Gore Drinker he's just gotta keep finding them they knew that Doran had popped his ulti mid lane to actually try to clear out that way so they're gonna
19:48
immediately go back towards top and look to punish and just Doran dying here
19:53
would have been would have been okay I think that you can come back from it's unfortunate but it happens but instead
19:58
what happens is they go in as the explosion from The Cask more than enough
20:04
to set it up and that was sexy if that doesn't for real if that doesn't happen
20:09
dumb on Kia is probably still overall behind in Gold absolutely but I don't think they thought Kellen would be up there still all right like he stayed up
20:16
top for so long the wave was crashing bots so my assumption is Genji's saying all right Keller will be heading down
20:21
towards bot to try to cover doc Dom and at worst we have a 3v3 and chovy's coming out of Base Toby's pretty strong
20:27
like we can fight but when that extra man is there the CC coming through from the Nami was massive because they're in
20:32
that tight Corridor they both get caught by the namiel they both get caught by Nami bubble and as much as I like the scaling of
20:39
Yumi and as as much of a blight has been on this tournament MF to me has had one big problem that she's unable to deal
20:46
with very tanky front lines and if we look across the board for Genji there is an everfrost rise there is ruler who
20:53
went for BT Rush with very high on the utility and the sustain but in terms of damage might not be enough you're
20:59
playing as a fat tank gragas and a monstrously Fed red cane that is what I
21:04
assume will be building either a Black Cleaver or a death stands next it's gonna be so hard to chew for those health bars it will but it looks like
21:10
there may be another contest here Genji is moving up but domood is more established for this so I think Genji
21:16
will have to back up give it up uh there is a bit of an X Factor in this one though and that really is the realm warp
21:21
right because yeah I do think being able to round more up Doran into that back line makes the fights very very
21:27
complicated for Dom one right because if they're trying to send all of their their kind of Frontline forward towards ruler and all of a sudden a very angry
21:33
crocodile shows up on top of Doc Dom's head that becomes a difficult fight there was also the amount of lockdown
21:38
that we keep going back to 4G NG because a single misposition from anyone on Dom one spells big trouble yeah getting the
21:46
5v5s is exactly what Genji are trying to do this game so far Canyon has made sure that is very very difficult as he's
21:52
going to be splitting here towards the bottom side yeah he's absolutely I mean I feel like
21:58
nauguri is actually kind of playing jungle gragas this game and it's still playing Kane as Canada yeah River gragas
22:05
and uh and just any side lane with Farm Kane as Canyon is ahead of him so yes I
22:11
think that they have a lot of experience playing with uh Canyon Nissan this is absolutely normal oh yeah when he's on
22:17
graves I feel like no one on the team is getting Farm anymore I mean what are his most famous picks like Graves nidalee
22:24
carthus like this fits the ammo 100 and what I love and what I meld up we
22:31
have a little bit of downtime I want to highlight this world so this match is one of the best showcases that we've
22:36
seen thus far is the amount of creativity and freedom that are available in drafts there are a couple of picks that are very clearly very far
22:43
ahead of the curve but overall as hold up might have some more fighting here yeah tidal wave to come through they think they've caught ruler he's going to
22:49
have to flash the bubble himself out of the way now Canyon towards that bottom side does a lot of
22:55
damage there to Dora and his naugery Holding On To The Cask as if Shirley takes down that outer turret and Damon
23:01
Kia are starting to really get the momentum they're looking for peanut turns up wanting to deny this second charge
23:10
there it is not going to get the blades reached but that's gonna get some flashes Nature's crossed to make sure
23:16
they get the charges showmaker will be exhausted immediately the bubble's fantastic as the culling flies through
23:21
and Canyon locks down that first kill but Toby will answer and he makes it a double round walk to deliver
23:29
Shoemaker sacrifices himself but gives over the triple that was way too far
23:34
from Dom one they really tried the hard for us that even tping on the herald to
23:39
keep it alive for the second charge but Genji are still in the area Genji can answer and show me picked up a triple
23:45
there this rise is not looking like the rise that we've been saying is just out of
23:51
the meta not really yeah if it's five kills it's probably yeah yeah he's freaking cool yeah
23:57
um right now that's a problem for a long time and you know trip in
24:04
general will get you a lot and I agree with you zail and this is something that has plagued on one for the entire year they used to be known as a team that
24:11
like gonna lead and pushed it relentlessly but sometimes they go too far yeah I mean you just have to look at who they're actually diving right it's
24:18
it's a Renekton with all that has a Yumi scrap and Pina on the maokai right if this was ruler anchovy under the tower
24:23
and those are your original targets then yeah you burst them down very very quickly but it's two essentially tanks
24:29
at this point in the game they can't actually get a quick kill yes they do knock down the Renekton but so many
24:34
resources are put into actually knocking him down that shovian ruler are completely unthreatened when they arrive
24:39
that emotion explosion as Jovi picks up a triple kill yeah uh he was actually a
24:44
little bit upset and I'm not going to translate what he said there because you can if you can lip read you know exactly what was spoken so all right uh having a
24:52
look the damage I mean this is once again just this is a canyon game these are the cut types of games right they're not looking for it yeah if
24:59
at first you don't succeed try try again they've been doing it all game long as uh we'd like to remind you that of
25:06
course this is our Mercedes featured matchup between Trophy and showmaker already it's delivering his door and oh
25:11
actually denied a bit of that CC by the bubble he keeps himself alive has some Zoomies there as well courtesy of
25:16
Legends but look at this the bounce back and forth between the two lanes you know they go just from bot up towards mid
25:22
they already have it pushed here and starting the chip away at that tier two and it's a very clear plan here from Dom
25:28
one it is fight fight fight the whole game long they want to scrap they don't want Genji to be able to establish
25:34
themselves in a 1-4 to get rise out to the side lane and they don't want them to have this kind of cushy front to back
25:39
slow paced game they really want to force their resources out non-stop oh as
25:45
a showmaker a little bit of noopsy there but uh he's fine he got he got his Z he's okay overall
25:51
um domon also have drafted a perfect draft for this right you have extremely mobile and extremely bursty bot Lane you'll have did I'd argue one of the
25:58
best CC jumps in the game in lissandra and then the Kane and Greg as we've already seen the impact of to me the big
26:04
question will be though for Darwin uh especially after the dive that they didn't find on what side is what is
26:11
actually going to be the amount of Drake so they're able to pick up because if you get into a late game scenario as Toby finds a really nice realmorph and
26:18
you don't have I think a drake lead that forces Genji to just walk into you to maybe get
26:24
caught inside or to opt into a skirmish that they don't really want to go for in a straight up front to back especially
26:29
with ruler with a Yumi on his back and the front line that he has can still be a really big problem and I am kind of
26:35
concerned about the fallback right you know if doctor was having an incredible game here on the Lucian then you can say okay the four-man Squad just keeps
26:41
fighting knockdown keeps farming and he's kind of your insurance policy but it doesn't really feel like they have one in this game uh maybe Katie will
26:48
prove me wrong and he can just be that threat the whole game long but I do have concerns that when you get to those really later stages if you don't have
26:55
that big secondary threat lahen's exhaust is always going to be on Cannon and I just don't know if he's gonna be
27:01
enough well speaking of secondary turrets it looks like Chubby's going for today prize uh here as well I think it
27:06
might be the fimbal winter instead oh no oh no thank goodness okay
27:12
I saw the film picked up my nugger he put it back into my head and I'm like okay thank goodness okay serifs it's
27:18
fine okay there are some builds that have happened
27:25
in the lck that we sometimes at times yeah we we cling to them no I bet here we are it's all right we're absolutely
27:30
fine well if you want to scare a dumb one friend uh compare the mid lane items
27:36
here yeah that's gonna be a problem as Toby is looking very strong yes uh zero
27:42
two and four not exactly the scoreline that show maker was looking for here but he still have all of that utility like
27:48
you were talking about Chronicles all of the CC that he does have and it's Canyon that's the uh the real one here
27:54
it was beautiful bit of the K Ram welcome everyone uh we
28:02
are pretty used to this trial Atlas it's okay exactly allowed the Drake is also up third one of the game Earth Wind and
28:09
Fire to start us off as well which I absolutely love another knock-offs come through but Doran pretty tanky is okay
28:15

blue,EG,IMPACT,INSPIRED,JOJOPYUN,DANNY,VULCAN,red,TL,BWIPO,SANTORIN,BJERGSEN,HANS SAMA,EYLA,TL,"0:00
the the season so far honestly he'll be nerfed in 12.3 but that's going to be locked in for jojobian and this is going
0:05
to be another new one for jojo he has played so many different champions already sold so many styles he's playing
0:11
melee carries he's playing range he's going to get actually two more games on the twisted fate uh previously
0:18
to get a test on his map play whippo praying to the top lane gods yeah
0:24
for do i get counter pick do i get a jungler gank for me santorina santhorn
0:30
tends to put his time towards mid lane but jarvan definitely good early ganker exactly and jarvan is very good again
0:35
versus a lot of these very popular mid laners that don't have dashes of their own twisted fate is one of those that
0:41
you also want to put pressure on early on to keep in mid lane or at least keep vision of them so i think jarvan is
0:47
actually a really good uh early pick here from team liquid for santorum it'll be interesting to see where tl goes as
0:52
far as mid if they want to just go towards something scaling you know control mage or if they want to go to where the more of the older school
0:58
answers uh things like the silas that can steal the tf vault and try to match the roams you can go aggressive
1:04
something like the leblanc to try to keep them you know pinned under tower utilize the the kill pressure of leblanc
1:09
plus jarvan to try to really lock him down you know there's kind of different schools of thought here yeah they're hovering the uh zillion here as a shout
1:16
out to bjergsen but yeah you know i think one of the other counters is probably more likely um
1:22
the silas always has been quite good as far as matching twisted fate roams plus
1:27
when we're talking about putting pressure on the twisted bait and we you brought up the jarvan we go for kill pressure there you can go for those
1:34
engages silas done plus knock-ups there from jarvan would be able to get the job done i have
1:39
to say picking a varus already seeing a jarvan is another backline carry for eg that is low mobility that will be a very
1:46
good target i wonder if tom kenzer is going to get banned out as a result by tl because that's gaining some popularity i tend to feel tom kinch is
1:53
actually really good in the later stages versus j4 you can eat your carry out of the cataclysm uh give a lot of defense
2:00
there yeah i'm actually interested to see what happens with this gwen uh of course we have seen impact add gwen to
2:06
the champion pool i'm also a very big fan of the build he goes for conqueror plus a uh cosmic drive second i think is
2:12
actually her optimal build so i think impact's like ahead of the build tech very very slightly uh but also she can be flexed into jungle we saw her in the
2:19
lck last night for example actually looks really good down there as well um she does have a somewhat weaker landing
2:25
phase you get to kind of bypass that with the champion so inspired tends to do well with these sort of melee mage carry champions so
2:31
could see the flux happen i think it's important that they grab the gwen in the first three uh because you're talking about the series for a team liquid where
2:38
football was hard carrying you know he he tried to do it on the graves got super far ahead pushed in the tower he's
2:44
running around the map he's doing all that he can but couldn't quite carry the team and then he's like next game gimme
2:49
gwen oh super hard carry and and does it so um see if he
2:55
what he's got here in an answer to going funnily enough you know graves is one of the champions that has been picked over
3:00
into gwen and he himself has actually used that match up very well could do that again eg
3:06
could bend it out here gangplank the first one that was one of the very popular early picks into gwen jenkins
3:12
definitely popularized that one as well uh so trying to protect a little bit impact there because they know whippo
3:17
can be a big problem and bobo is one of those guys that that is not afraid to bring out you know a more risky pick you
3:23
know he brought out things like the rengar you know i would be interested to see if he's going to be bring out you know something like that or the jacks
3:28
that actually scales very well some of these more risky side lane split
3:34
pushers that can scale against it i think can be really effective i would say it is problematic though because
3:39
you're facing a real twisted fate yes i do like silas into twisted fate as far as stealing it and the possibilities
3:45
there but the actual real twisted fate will often get an early move you know especially if you don't have vision
3:50
control and if you play a counter match up like that that wants to really scale and take advantage then it
3:56
gets risky one caveat i will give i mean it's not going to be jax it doesn't really matter but counter-strike also great against gold card you know can
4:02
block that and that's something i've been wanting to see more of in the lcs haven't started out i think a lot of it is just it's harder to team fight you
4:08
know graves is kind of kind of work with the composition here pretty well you know be able to push in the gwen early
4:13
group and team fight a lot more effectively than something like the jacks so tl has been largely playing a lot of
4:19
these really low engage style comps at least this time they do have the j4 but they've been really preferring a lot of
4:26
of kind of depending on being first to a neutral objective to force a fight with their opponent i think eg needs something to
4:32
kind of pull pull some structure to their team fight okay because they did have two offensive melee you know
4:39
carries here with the gwen and the viego but abram actually brings a lot to the the team fight for them not necessarily
4:46
so much you know for the lane phase very defensive option for them on that side
4:51
of the map and we have saved support picks for last so it is tl getting counterfeit down here brahm not a good
4:57
offensive pick you can kind of freely scale against him and great affiliates lulu there's almost no way you kill us
5:03
in lane unless tf shows up and we i would say outscale them exactly
5:08
this is for sure a vulcan pick for the team here for rob to bring it together because as i say too you've got your two
5:15
melee carries gwen viego so good at jumping in there uh getting the proc on
5:20
brom very quickly with the passive if he's able to land a cue also it sets up a crazy level one for eg you've got
5:28
brahm so much early power here they could actually you know try and get some deep vision
5:33
we've seen themes be rewarded very heavily for preparation and going for
5:38
these level ones so hopefully they've got something to really utilize this power because braum
5:43
is definitely one of the best level ones it's really interesting because i mean eg can can play 131 very effectively but
5:49
i also think you know with a rapid fire tf and a varus you can also just fish for long range gold cards you have the
5:54
ability to follow up with a fair team liquid squad has showed quite a few options all right we are onto this one
5:59
welcome to the rift welcome to the lcs lock in finals our second ever 10th year
6:06
of lcs here and it's going to be a fun one the new look evil geniuses 17 year
6:12
old jojo pyon a rookie in the mid lane former lec mvp inspired brought over
6:19
vulcan from cloud nine and evil geniuses look like the team to beat undefeated so far unlocking looking like number one
6:25
team liquid playing what essentially is going to be their starting roster for the foreseeable future
6:31
with ayla at support whippa coming over from europe and bjergsen back in from retirement well from coaching not the
6:37
same thing that is different it is different to be fair well i mean he did retire as a player yeah he did so i think i think
6:44
you're still safe in that regard and i've got to give bjergsen a lot of credit you know i was one of the people that i think was doubting a little bit
6:50
how good he would be coming back you know having watched him stream a fair bit i felt like he was making a lot more mistakes than he used to but coming into
6:57
lock-in i think he's he's been arguably the best performing mid laner at the very least he's up there with jojo i
7:03
think he's been really really impressive and that's the exciting part to me is that the next name i was going to offer
7:10
is literally his opponent here jojo who people have also been skeptical on for
7:15
very different reasons you know bjergsen extremely experienced and coming off of
7:21
you know semi-retirement from coaching but jojo coming up the new young guns
7:26
north american talent and a lot of people not giving full credit to the
7:32
early hype train of you know academy lovers who who really you know want want to be on the
7:38
on the bleeding edge but he has performed extremely well so far in lock-in i think deserving of a lot of
7:45
the hype yeah it shows that the hype is is very much real and people you know from eg and people from other other
7:50
teams than in the academy scene were really trying to sell me on this guy uh and and i'm you know full full steam
7:55
ahead on this i am full steam ahead now i am by nature a skeptic you know
8:02
obviously background all in math and sciences and so you have to be skeptic at first but i think i've seen enough
8:08
data i'm on the train yeah you're like okay this is worth investigating like this has some promise can't disprove it
8:13
can't okay you know maybe it's true yeah and we're in there right now i'll just blindly have faith and sometimes that
8:18
works too and checking in on that mid lane as we said jarvan can gank early but santorum goes over a ward so inspired to hear for the council
8:26
there's the gold card shield as i'm gonna find that first done a double shot as well yeah you gotta eq back out that trinket wart put in that bottom river
8:32
brush is mvp i also want to point out how jojo's been playing this lane uh
8:38
very very frequent harassment only one potion now bjergsen finally tugs his last potion here uh on silas and he's
8:44
been very effective at denying this yes while getting the harassment down even looking for the zone there's no way you
8:50
kill him yeah with that heel coming in zone off the off the minions that are dying they're still trying to die more
8:55
to bjergsen silas you always have this problem of trying to trade your health for your lane control and it seems like
9:02
he's having a difficult time keeping that one up bjergsen though will have to use the last remnants of his health
9:07
before he teleports absolutely well it's kind of funny because santorum walked past that drink award and it was about to expire but knowing that there was the
9:14
counter gank he's like oh i got spotted in awards we immediately went back to the river walked through the same path was a sweeper on but the ward expired
9:21
before he got there so he never actually got to get uh that payout of at least clearing out that ward and up on the top
9:27
side buppo gonna have to be a bit careful here as inspired is gonna help impact just reset this wave
9:32
and potentially grab some crux for himself okay yeah i'm looking at this one this could be interesting because tl
9:39
have managed to sit in a brush that i believe isn't warded so potentially eg plays up too far they don't go for the
9:44
turbo push they don't burn out all their cooldowns in mana so all right we walk back in play for the wave normally this would have been a normal reset timing
9:50
though if you're gonna recall you recall in front of a cannon it means that they push you don't lose more than a single melee minion uh so it was a nice attempt
9:56
to debate it doesn't mean anything though and teal or sorry first and dive play it safely top side is where we're looking now ginger phone is little five
10:02
whiffer now the same just a long sword no potions left but as the wave is cleared out whipple able to keep it off
10:08
his tower no dive one of the most robust parts about graves you have so much aoe
10:13
clearing the wave there denying the possible dive the joe uh the rome from jojo and because of the ward in
10:20
tri-brush even can stop the recall and delay this twisted fate more denying cs yes the teleport can be used to get
10:27
there quickly but that's a couple more dropped due to the rome uh up to the top side and impact's going
10:32
to trade lanes yep just going to be able to to base there and he wanted to be back to try to catch the wave that was out of the tower
10:38
because jojo was going to lose a full wave um but what this has bought tl is whipple actually fending that off means
10:44
bergson catches up in farm and gets another free base because he actually had the tv back very early he was down
10:49
two full waves he matched that farm in the time that jojo spent going top and then basing then he gets another free
10:54
recall to actually buy another item and walk back to lane so you know all of the kind of earlier lane was that person had
11:00
now pretty much erased the bonuses of absorbing pressure from
11:06
the top lane uh and denying the possible play there the time spent i'm looking forward to time spent from
11:12
inspire down towards the bottom lane though because inspired versus han sama is also another
11:18
cool matchup it's not an exact lane match-up but obviously the former teammates
11:23
looking to one-up each other now that they've come over to the lcs you can see how much how much respect
11:28
bobo is actually paying to the fact that tf can make these realms and that he may be that that focus of pressure early
11:34
merc treads as his first buy here is pretty atypical uh for our graves but going against viego stun the
11:39
point-and-click gold card there's a lot of cc on this team and the mri move speed is going to be helpful against gwen so i think it makes sense if you're
11:45
saying my role in this game is just to clear the wave and stand at my tower and not die while the rest of my team gets
11:51
things done yeah so far it would be a small checkbox here for team liquid because they avoided the early rome
11:57
timer from eg and santorin as we said from champs like with this jarvan trying to put that pressure on twisted bait
12:03
this was the third pass that he made for by mid lane before transitioning down to
12:09
the dragon to pick up team liquid's first objective and well done that my first has been useful obviously it is a
12:14
500 gold lead still to eg most of that is not tf passes they are outlaying the opposition but to you what the first
12:20
dragon actually looks pretty good um not the best individual dragon stats wise uh it doesn't give you a whole lot that you care about but uh it is starchy one it
12:28
does start to in the past that if you are looking for a dragon soul later on in the game well you're already a quarter of the way there it's gonna look pretty good top lane is scrapping back
12:34
and forth like the merchants from whippo we got a lot of hard stuns from the entire rest of the team you can tenacity almost everybody and you're getting
12:40
magic damage in the lane so i am a big fan of that one and now we get a fight in the top side as the oldest come across decent damage whippo attacks the
12:46
minion for more the q's come out the big ulti the flash from the q able to sidestep inspired stun no death on a
12:52
whippo and one of the important things in the escape here whenever you're playing versus gwen so critical to move sideways when she
12:59
jumps at you with the q because the center of the snip snip does so much
13:04
more and some people would get kind of lazy you know and and just uh you know face tank it or try and run in a
13:10
straight line but it's very critical to sidestep uh the middle avoid a lot of that damage whipple had pretty pretty
13:17
good movement there also dodges out on the w stun tonight oh almost one auto would have been the stun halo's already
13:22
down flash but it's nothing picked up tf yes they're showing up on both sides bjergsen's here first and then his first
13:28
blow to the bottom lane vulcan can find a slow but not much else as the squad runs away staying alive barely but
13:34
summoners are down for eg and the kill on the board for team liquid yeah a huge room there down from bjergsen arriving
13:40
first with that stolen tf ulti they're the ones that come out on top on this gets a kill and now they're gonna be
13:46
able to take place i mean han salma had those truck rooms all stacked up and was fighting back very heavily as they were
13:52
trying to burst down ayla he returned so much damage when bjergsen arrives it's an easy kill over onto danny they push
13:58
it in they get the plate they have a 20 cs lead almost on this base for hansa so he's gonna have a really nice buy plus
14:05
this is gonna mean a lot moving forward you already have first dragon if you're able to get that advance for your bottom
14:10
side uh continue stacking up but here it is the flash and heel forward from danny had been used early so that's why so
14:17
successful from bjergsen as he comes in a split second before before jojo uh the
14:23
attempt there a lit just like one second of difference yeah if they had been a little bit more proactive in
14:29
coordinating that there and actually been able to punish uh could have been completely the other story absolutely
14:35
and danny i think just needed one more auto on to ayla you know to actually proc that wrong passive that's why he was going for that flash forward if you
14:42
get that passive stun your q is guaranteed you're gonna get that kill and the fight can look pretty different
14:47
but unfortunately for them it's these slim margins and tl getting the best of them so far han sama had the white gun that meant
14:53
the damage was really high from the chuck rooms and it looked tough and again the first step from mid lane
14:58
so critical and you saw how uh a couple of seconds could mean the difference because if you're
15:04
coordinating ahead of time and your twisted fate ultimate no matter who's holding it uh is the one that gets to
15:11
join that play earlier if they had been on the offensive there here's the follow-up though from team liquid level
15:16
six on santorin so they have full authority here moving into the jungle after chunking out twisted fate and even
15:22
bringing bjergsen down for the follow-up and this really hurts for danny because he was down 20 cs off of that previous
15:28
play and now getting zoned off more farm more plates being donated over here to hansama so
15:34
danny significantly down in gold now to this felios that is gonna scale really
15:39
nicely you know into the mid game here with this lulu in the back pocket the kind of the trade-off has been on the
15:44
other side inspired has been farming much more efficiently than santorin you know he farms faster the j4 has been
15:50
looking for more ganks but it does mean that there's a lot more pressure i think uninspired to try to make something
15:55
happen with his gold advantage and it's more difficult for him to do so because look at the summoner spells danny having
16:02
blown his offensively there uh has nothing for the follow-up play and hansama has both cleanse and flash ready
16:09
in addition to completing his gale force kill force to be the single most
16:14
influential 80 carry item there is in the game we got a fight we got a tf this time
16:20
around whip i don't have a teammate to show up wizards fellas are gonna land and impact finds the kill eg gonna play
16:26
for top lane this is the way they're gonna get back into this game yeah back up to the top lane again here they do
16:31
punish the missing flash whipple was trying to reset the wave and it's a really nice timing here by eg getting up
16:39
there able to punish and you can see the kind of setup that they have this line of pink wards across that top side river is
16:47
covering jojo pyon on these roams so he can cheat out a lane any time he pushes out the wave he can disappear into fog
16:53
and blippo can't always play with respect to that or he's gonna lose the freeze and now look at this what really
16:59
matters is teleport used back to the top side so this dragon stacking in jeopardy
17:04
14 liquid evil geniuses they've got the teleport advantage with impact still holding his it's not unleashed yet so
17:11
you would have to teleport to your tower but you could try and trade top plates if you wanted to cut out the dragon
17:18
stacking from team liquid early on they don't look like they're making that choice because they're sending gwen back up to the wave that's at top side they
17:25
value that gold and denying whippo you know working all of those turret plates off on top side but it does set up this
17:31
kind of looming factor of the dragon stacking 14 liquid going according to plan and i think it would have been a
17:36
tough fight for eg given that there's no ulti on impact no ulta on jojo so even if you tp down might have been difficult
17:42
to execute on and and then you're gonna lose multiple plates but in this case impact doesn't tp to bot side loses a
17:48
plate topside and they lose the dragon so impact i think is is more setting up for an unleashed gp play post 14 minutes
17:55
he didn't want to spend it now so look for eg to try to make a proactive cross map play as soon as that 14 minute mark
18:01
is alright here's some herald pressure of course whippo's flash is back up as ulta soon impact his ghost in the previous fight so not a big play for him
18:07
and though one triplet was taken that one's going to be shared 50 50 but now vulcan can start the time whipple burns the flash no wave right now means wait
18:14
for this one clear out the wave everyone's gonna be talking and vulcan's down to half hp so it's time to run away inspired says i'm not on a ward that's
18:20
fine whippo completely fearless chasing it down three opponents and indeed they'll have to walk away so
18:26
the herald just gives 160 a piece nothing else claimed for that one tl already two dragons to zero
18:33
whippo is such a chad every time there's an opening and you can see it from their
18:38
information on the minimap how they know the positioning of each player he uses this window to go
18:45
aggressive on three people push back so quickly that they're gonna get just as many plates because han summer has the
18:50
white gun does take tower aggro there with his uh attempt with the green gun harassment
18:56
onto impact but still able to push it out extremely quickly right back and get a plate for themselves
19:02
almost two and he's gonna be going clips again here so he's not going shield bow even though
19:07
he has been really under a lot of pressure i wouldn't have been surprised to see him go shield beau this game you know shielbo still by far the most
19:13
common but he's gone lethality every time he has actually played for this we'll see if he wants to go you know full on aggressive style build or film
19:20
maybe at least go like a defensive lethality item edge of night or something could be potentially effective playing against someone like the df okay
19:26
they have the ultimate han solo flash and cleanser down but he's already stunned second time gold card low stun
19:31
duration but the kill is in vulcan's gonna guarantee the second one as well ayla burns the ulti but he weighs the two minute cooldown
19:38
for nothing two more kills the board evil genius is back alive this is huge for them too because they can then
19:44
finally push down this top outer turret uh for themselves try and get some of that map control back that is a big
19:50
commitment of resources but if you look at the state of the map there was nothing pushing out for team liquid
19:55
except for the top side so a very good window taken advantage of there by evil geniuses
20:01
oh an impact going aggressive now on santorini who uses eq john santorum has a flash e to follow it's back up last
20:07
ulti brings them low and there's the snip snip kill four to one right now a tp is safety just barely bears believe
20:14
that that's done was a half second for hitting him yeah santorin there just really kind of over your side step yeah
20:20
good side step there i mean say torrent eq's in to secure the red buff with this might but then impact says well you got
20:26
no way out bud okay i'll take that red buff right off your corpse gwen baby the chase is always there and the dive in
20:33
fact pulls aggro though as the wave gets pinned down both gonna start it up yet again in spite of that but inspired as aggro and spy is gonna die to the tower
20:40
oh a misplayed tower dive the turret warmed up by over aggression from impact
20:46
that looked like a little bit of panic because they drew tower aggro too early as uh impact jumped in big punish there
20:53
from team liquid just as eg were getting so much momentum yeah blippo able to fend that one off and it felt like yeah
20:59
maybe maybe just a little bit of miscommunication because impact clearly didn't want to die and he was backing up but vulcan and inspired were posturing
21:05
for that and maybe thought they were going to be able to grab it anyway but now impact let's play this a little bit safe that's one of those ones where you
21:11
want to play the comms back and here because it looked like it was a bittle a
21:16
little bit kind of confused comms meanwhile it's gonna be of the reset though for both teams right back out
21:22
onto the riff santorum trying to get his vision control back from the other side of the map and i want to see if jojo can find this window to punish osama again
21:29
because they got that killed topside and we didn't get to talk about it but that was both summoners down plus the kill right and now tf ulti is back here once
21:36
again both cleanse and flash are down on the han sama so he is very vulnerable if
21:41
they can find an opportunity but he is gonna be hugging the tower for now and eg will at least move towards the herald
21:47
all righty well second herald can be really valuable no bounties of speakers of course but it can knock you down a pretty good turret keep my second herald
21:54
does deal more damage in the first goes from a minimum of 2k to almost 3 000 with a late herald so you might see a
22:00
turret die and that can get some gold back it'll nearly one shot midterm here and it would be really big if they could
22:05
actually get a good setup to put it mid because then they truly get the advantage on actually
22:11
oh flash and han sonic and they get the rest is the question is brahm hits the front line and gwen's here as well hans
22:17
summoned immune to death has now a backline access wifo finds the kill assassination on the danny and eg may
22:23
have to run away stolen brahmal sets it up and they find the second kill it's a one for one though two for two overall
22:28
but now they keep on going pearson leading the charge looking for kill number four t already winning a red card by some time blast play it to safety
22:35
just barely you cannot stop wimbo in the back line there he's popping off again
22:41
no matter how much this man gets focused he is incredible and guess what that's
22:47
dragon number three again while we're building up to this fight so much the
22:52
output here is critical dragon number three soul point for team liquid so early in this game and one of the big
22:58
mistakes there that wasn't the gold card there was actually a red card so a lot more damage did come out from hansa before he did go down and then you
23:04
actually watch the detail end of this fight that the j4 ulti comes through and inspired is not able to access the
23:10
clone he can't actually pick up the dead body here because it's just over the wall he gets trapped inside he's trying
23:16
to click on the lulu for the ulti reset but he got put on the opposite side of the cataclysm wall how do you got the
23:22
resets for the spam are there that could have been a one fight for eg but that tiny difference changed it completely
23:28
yeah inspired knows how to get penta kills on viego but just a little bit out of reach there
23:35
can't get the reset bjergsen was able to go back in for the sun i also wanted to say wipo in his 2v1 on the top half of that
23:43
fight at the beginning to kill off danny's was so good getting result just around to be able to finish him off
23:50
burst it through kind of saves the fight because off of that first kill from impact uh eg were looking like they were
23:56
going to gain the momentum so nice recovery there from team liquid and the rewards for that recovery were ginormous
24:03
i'm just so impressed with with the position that buffalo was now in this game right you know how many times did they go towards top lane you know he's
24:09
up 20 plus cs has the same score line now as impact and that's just such a
24:15
difficult situation to deal with but now fiji may have overextended here everyone from tl is around shields back down
24:20
vulcan dangerously loads vulcan will die santorum buys a lot of time over the top but it's one kill back a second one
24:27
picked up now as well do we get the resets not long enough and now just left alone impact will die a quadrical
24:35
the burger king is back tl just absolutely eviscerate eg there pushing
24:42
up for vision t.l was ready for it you can see pimpo he is so happy and the
24:47
player comes they are popping off they know this game is truly in their hands jojo was talking earlier in his
24:54
interview with travis who is this bjergsen guy what has he really got to
25:00
do let's see what's so special about him well now it's a six kill silas let's
25:05
take another look at this fight though whippo and santorum starting it off he gets such an early health lead onto
25:10
vulcan and then santorin right into the center of them lulu ultimate for the
25:16
follow-up knock-up they all get annihilated against the edge of the cataclysm there man you can see how
25:22
clear the comms were too that was a q flash from the graves as the cataclysm is coming through they all get locked in
25:29
on the end of the line there the q knock back the alti over top look at how much damage pippo did no hesitation when he's
25:36
playing this lethality graves he flashes in to maximize damage across three eg characters and bjergsen it's cleanup
25:43
time and the reason that whipple always has this high of damage is he's always starting out these fights as graves you
25:50
know walking up just forcing it face-first auto-attacking to try and get his uh his
25:57
health lead very early on and so him and santorin starting that out on vulcan and team liquid no hesitation it bodes so
26:05
well for them you know this team is all behind him ready to join on this play
26:10
and now richard actually going to get taken out before she gets up to the turret at all so that second neutral
26:16
objective goes down into the dirt you earn 100 for killing it you get 25 back when they claim it it's not the best
26:22
neutral to claim keep in mind we are 80 seconds away from infernal soul for team
26:28
liquid if your poke was good before if your burst was good before it gets even better whippo's gonna love this one it
26:34
deals adaptive damage so he's got the armpit for that physical burst to do even more and the one shots are going to happen this neutrality build it's early
26:40
game skewed but he's killed him in the early game i think he just plays so aggressively with it right he actually makes the most of it is the thing that
26:47
impresses me most is that his playstyle always makes sense with his build right you know whether it's it's the craziness
26:53
of the scion you know in the early game split pushing with the hull breaker and then he's gonna start grouping so he goes back towards the redemption in
26:59
these games he's playing lethality he's playing burst heavy he's not kiting back and hitting a front liner he is flashing
27:05
on the carries chunking them for 60 70 80 percent of their health and sure in a lot of the fights when he's played it he
27:11
dies but he's dealt such an overwhelming amount of damage that it doesn't matter because he has already won the fight for
27:16
his team and now that he's done so much work and and won that fight for the team you've got to turn your eyes towards the
27:23
person who collected the gold from the fight bjergsen already well on his way to completing the cosmic drive for silas

blue,T1,ZEUS,ONER,FAKER,GUMAYUSI,KERIA,red,G2,BROKENBLADE,JANKOS,CAPS,FLAKKED,TARGAMAS,T1,"0:00
well either both are safe or a strong side of the map they can either play towards it or they can leave zeus on his
0:05
own to be defensive whoa it is very much up to his discretion is g2 gonna very quick respond together remember that
0:11
this can be flexed between both mid and support eg played at support obviously there is the ability to flex that around
0:16
the gp i think is the most standard answer but broken blade i don't think it's really as much in his comfort zone
0:21
he did play it against t1 last time and g2 played very heavily towards him with
0:26
it but it didn't really end up resulting in much of an advantage for them you know broken blade wasn't really able to
0:32
make good on all the ganks that jankos spent up towards that top lane yeah no exactly right and now with the
0:37
gangplank being locked in i really like this it keeps things so ambiguous for g2 and this works especially well with
0:43
callista still on the board right because kalista works very well with galio there towards the bottom side if
0:48
you do want to put him in um to a situation like that flex it towards the mid lane or not so still keeping things
0:56
very much up in the air here for g2 speaking of which they are going to be locked in and we'll see what faker is going to take away for the first round
1:01
of picks here for t1 expectations are that t1 is one of the strongest of the game teams that we have at this tournament and already you can see that
1:08
emulated in their draft zaya can be a very dominant laner especially when paired up with things like the rakan gwen known for her strong laning and so
1:15
far it seems that tion is just trying to gain some control over the top and bot side of the map the jarvan locked in
1:20
here for yankos this is something he hasn't played as much at msi but was really loving in the lec i think it really does fit his play style even at
1:27
msi we saw him pulling off so many three camp ganks on things like graves you're not expecting on with the j4 he can find
1:33
these creative angles he can really get in get active in the early game and to me that spells that they want to play it
1:38
very very aggressive here early on the g4 is gonna be a great champion to do it with yeah and also with the gangplank
1:44
there towards the top side you let lessen the opportunities for something like a camille like the galio delivery
1:49
system is something that uh java nizora has always been very good at but they weren't going to take their opportunity to get rid of the kaiser of course zaya
1:56
kaiser we've uh we all remember those days and leblanc is going to be taken away alongside the second half of the
2:01
lovers duo in the rakhan sorry medic it's not going to happen today i think the kaiser ban makes a lot of sense here
2:07
to me by far that has been flakkad's best champion you know he's been really dominant on it and i think he's gonna
2:12
have to prove that he can really perform to the level of gimme uc and caria on
2:17
other champions if g2 are gonna be successful in this series you can't just depend on that one pick because he's going to get targeted well my
2:24
expectation is that mf will be the direction that they go for i do like the center band i think that that actually makes a lot of sense because when we
2:30
think about the gallium as a flex senegale was one of the common go-to's that you could draft towards the bot side of the map um but mf is the other
2:37
one that i do think of uh he did play a lot of zeri during the well playoffs and of course we did see it a little bit at
2:43
the beginning of msi but yeah very debatable if it is still considered strong was actually something during the
2:48
regular season he played a lot of as every 80 carry on the planet did you guys play jinx
2:57
i know crazy but notice again that we are saving that final pick for that mid-slash support
3:04
they've kept the gallia was a flex and it's gonna largely depend on how t1 choose to round up the draft as they
3:09
continue with this strong boss side of strong laners the renata plaza a very powerful 2v2 i really like granada
3:16
because of what g2 is drafting you're kind of assuming it's gonna be a lot of dive right it's gonna be a lot of coming at you here you know with the galia with
3:22
the j4 with the gp the disengage here the ability to do that with the renault ulti and also the w if you're just
3:28
trying to zero out one target can be massive this is so interesting tristana
3:34
gonna be locked in for faker but this is assuming that galio is going into the
3:39
middle so we knew of course we'd spoken about it already that that is definitely a flex
3:44
pick but seems like faker doesn't mind that whatsoever tristana going to be picked up and most likely heading
3:50
towards that mid lane unless there's some zaya shenanigans or if you want to put it top lane like who knows
3:56
it actually can work really well against gp so there is a slight possibility i'm expecting it to be for that that galio match up here
4:02
um but it is going to be wow playing the pike so they're just going to play into it now i am assuming it is
4:09
going to be matrist on a mid is much more common it's a lot easier to kind of stay safe in that mid lane than in a long extended lane with this marksman
4:16
but you do have some really strong early aggressive matchups almost always you're going towards hail of blade unless you want to kind of index towards later on
4:22
but with halo blade and ignite you do have the potential to all in very early if you can get lane pressure we know how
4:28
tristana can farm these turret plates but that being said if you do misstep against the galio j4 that is a duo that
4:35
can punish you very very heavily and if tris gets behind early in that mid lane you can start feeling pretty useless
4:42
uh when i look at this g2 draft i think it's very simplistic in its approach and when we think back to their uh playoff
4:48
run it is very straightforward easy to execute with a lot of early game options as well in particular you can see with
4:53
the mobility on target mass and his pike and the j4 being able to be active in the early game g2 do have early game
4:59
options prioritizing their scaling team fighting later i think what is terrifying about the c1 draft is they
5:04
have very dominant laners all across the board they have an ability to build their own advantages off uh their own
5:10
champions on top of that a huge amount of skill expression exists all across the board with things like the zaya ultimate the gwen w a lot of ways to
5:17
avoid and disengage away from a lot of the dive that will exist so even if g2
5:22
are able to find these fights i think that t1 have options even if on paper it seems that g2 will be favored in the 5v5
5:28
i mean so much of it is going to be about the initial seconds of the fight because if g2 don't find that perfect engage there's buster shot and rocket
5:35
jump from justana there's the ultimate from ziya there's the disengaging ultimate there from renata you know if
5:40
you're trying to dive through that you all get caught up in that you are going to get shredded it can become very very difficult so g2 have
5:47
got to be on point you know hit that perfect engage have the follow-up try to get that first kill with the pike and
5:52
we'll see if they can do it yeah well here we are game number one t1 versus g2 here at the msi 2022
6:00
knockout stage both of these teams this series just means so so much g2 can they do it again
6:08
in a best of five can t1 really prove that this is the new look
6:14
for the squad and they can uh get all of those former shadows away
6:19
she's going to walk away from g2 here spotted for a second there by caps but it looks like he will be okay flaps his way out so
6:26
tijuan they have information on this and you can immediately see the cross map trying to get a little bit of information on g2's top side jungle
6:34
would you two look to split the map here or are they just gonna drop a bit of vision and then disengage they will i
6:40
mean they're staying around a long time they definitely want to go split map this is actually um very similar but on opposite
6:45
sides of the map to what happened in their second round robin game um where it was you know jankos playing top half
6:51
split map towards broken blade on the gp and it was t1 playing down towards their bottom lane you know trying to get
6:57
kumiyushi ahead uh so we'll see now you know with yanko's playing more towards that bottom side and t1 have the info we
7:04
are very likely to end up in that cross map situation and we're gonna have to find out how well can broken blade really withstand the onslaught because
7:10
he's the one that's gonna be left to his own devices and trying to survive up there and we've seen it's been difficult on both sides
7:16
of this matchup they are certainly knowing this one very very well gentlemen i do want to draw your
7:21
attention to that mid lane it is our featured matchup presented by mercedes-benz and uh faker having paid
7:29
about 72 unique champions um so far in his career he does have some stats on
7:35
tristana currently undefeated four and zero my kind of sample size um it's a
7:40
very very low one it was a couple of years ago that he played it last but does have some experiences we also have a fight on the bottom side of the map
7:46
targamous though he's going down very very low the ignite is ticking kumihushi gonna have to back away though and it
7:51
looks like the pike will slink into fog of war and heal up g2 able to get level two first there and
7:57
going for the aggressive all-in this is something they've been really consistent with when they have that pike they want to look for the early kills but it is
8:04
now pike without summoners but trading summoners like this aggressively when it is split map and your junglers on your
8:09
side is great for g2 because now down flash could fall prey to a
8:14
jankos gank exactly that uh azalea and i think it's important to recognize that you know atlas wanted to talk about this
8:20
mid lane matchup but we have to keep our eyes on bot because gt's whole game plan here has been about trying to shut this
8:25
bot lane down jankos will be spotted on awards disappear as well yeah they don't
8:32
actually spot it yeah we'll just start off on the cross they're setting up for the dive potentially with the wave beginning to stack up of course mid
8:39
won't be able to roam down caps does have the tp but won't really be able to leverage it this early on broken blade is the person we have to keep our eyes
8:44
on as he runs out of manner and owner looks for the dive yeah they're going to see whether they can navigate this one stun does come through
8:50
broken blade burning down that is gonna be first one the flash comes in can caps chase after him though 300 health on the
8:56
viego as he tries to get the stab through it's a decent attempt for a stun but owner is going to be taken down
9:02
saying there's no flash of course and caps is going to walk it out meanwhile on the bottom side flacco takes down kumiyushi what is happening down here
9:09
carrie is looking for the last shot fake is gonna pick up the kill in the end and that's a double for the best player in
9:14
the world it's madness across the map here five kills four minutes in t1 g2 we
9:21
have to take stock of everything here that has happened though caps teeping up towards that top side does get a kill
9:26
and gets out but he's dropping waves to do it faker he was able to push in the wave go towards bot get two kills so to
9:32
me the big winner by far here is faker in the mid lane and we'll have to see if
9:37
g2 on the other side can really make use of this one kill that they got flak at uh because he is now quite ahead of
9:42
kumiyushi who lost that farm on the dive and did not get to kill himself yeah a lot of things that has highlighted just
9:50
happened in a very short period of time i'm curious as to where the replay is going to start so we're going to have a look at this bot lane as you can see a
9:55
level advantage for g2 the aggro starts by being taken by targamus then they're going to set up the focus onto gumiyushi
10:01
but the damage onto yankovsk and the fact to flack it can't kill kumiyushi quickly enough means the faker has enough time to get down here and look
10:07
he's in the perfect position to set up for these two kills throws the ignite down on to flack it carries gonna throw down those auto attacks to help secure
10:14
that kill and faker's gonna shut down onto yankov so just really good response there from faker the dive didn't go out
10:20
the way in which g2 wanted and on the top side of the map t1 pulled off a well-executed dive themselves so t1 with
10:27
a very big lead already but they're looking for a repeat now they know the summoners are still down on kubiushi
10:32
caps though spotted out and owner gonna intercept here make things a little bit awkward as fakers now cheating down
10:37
they're gonna collapse harry's gonna handshake cap series we're gonna try and get out the blast coin's gonna disappear though and he does have the taunt but
10:42
that's exactly what he wanted i think fake is going to jump over the wall and it's just a matter of a few seconds can
10:48
these double buffs actually be taken here by t1 as faker i think should be able to get an auto in oh
10:55
it is going to be owner of the locks down the kill so it claims the double buffs and faker looked like he didn't want to take it well i think
11:01
it was one of those situations where there's never really a bad one right either junglers get a double buffs for a fresh or the mid laner gets another kill
11:08
but the fact that g2 they keep trying to attack the spotlight and the action continues yeah flakker taking a fair bit
11:14
of damage here as targamus is going to disappear for a moment owners down here as well though
11:20
and it feels like both of these teams just testing each other at every single turn yeah absolutely they're both fully
11:25
down to scrap here you know faker i think he would have liked the kill but probably would have to commit his flash to get it and just decide it's not
11:30
really worth expending that flash to do so we'll hold on to it he is getting very far ahead of caps though because
11:36
capps has been aggressively roaming and is in this counter matchup but we can see jankos now out around mid and faker
11:42
is very far pushed up with no warts so potentially they could make something happen but it looks like jankos is heading to bot yeah flaca's in a little
11:49
bit of trouble here his owner's going to rotate over looking for some vision that control ward is going to spot him out as
11:54
he makes his way in yankos as well completely unseen right now as faker moves himself out of the brush that
12:00
control ward would spot the jarvan if he was going to come in but right now going to stay in fog of war explosive charge
12:06
onto caps it's just such a difficult matchup here for the galileo the experience difference is really starting
12:12
to build though especially along with the gold lead the tier one have been able to accrue notice that there's a jungle experience lead of course the
12:18
mid-experienced leader zuzail was already highlighting with caps roaming around the map so much the bot lane given that they've been able to weather
12:24
the storm have done a really good job and it surprises me because when we think about expectations coming into
12:30
this matchup t1 was expected to get this early game lead especially with the draft that they
12:36
have drafted for themselves the fact that g2 trying to be so aggressive in the early game to try and match and
12:41
challenge this they had a very clear game plan of attack the bot side of the map um but now worried for g2 because
12:47
this early game style is not something that we typically see from them this level of aggression is not something that we often see from them and now it's
12:53
only going to make those team fights that they want to play towards even harder it absolutely is and we know that
12:59
t1 is just so deadly with a lead in nine out of their 10 rumble games they were able to grab that first herald in 10 out
13:06
of their 10 rumble games they're able to secure first tower never once giving up a tower pre-14 of their own
13:13
and when t1 gets ahead and they're able to grab the herald they can snowball that game very very quickly faker
13:19
already has the push here he's got about a plate and a bit down on that mid lane tower if he gets a bit more chip damage that's dead to the herald yep but you
13:26
have to remember that in the first game these two teams faced off in 5 000 gold was the advantage that t1 managed to
13:32
accrue in the early stage of the game and that seemed to be g2's sweet spot i remember that i was there and um it hurt
13:39
my feelings a little bit yeah it's uh certainly something that uh history has denoted before but g2 now looking for an
13:45
opportunity on the bottom side commuting carrier not going to give them that one but red and white guns going to tear
13:51
through that turret beautifully here for flaccid and g2 look to have the game plan of we're going to try and get our
13:56
bot lane as far ahead as we possibly can and then hope that we can win these later game team fights so i like the
14:02
initial decision from g2 i like the response from t1 even more dropping the
14:07
herald mid i think makes so much sense because it gives you so much more map control and
14:12
faker's ability to see just super strong as they look for another dive yeah cataclysm is going to start this one up as jankos trying to get out of there is
14:19
going to survive for now kumushi looking to get out the ignite is ticking down but it looks like he might have got himself to relative safety no the answer
14:25
is absolutely not and it's a great dive to come on through even though g2 uh punch each other just a little bit on
14:31
the way out it's not gonna be enough to turn it but look at mid lane they got two towers two full towers there faker
14:37
if we get a look at the gold lead is gonna be astronomically ahead already has the myth to complete here
14:43
uh well capps has got some steel shoes and the kindle jam and you look at broken blade as well he
14:49
can't approach that tower because of the control that t1 have admitted the threat of a dive is very real so he's going to
14:54
lose a whole wave off the back of that zeus is building a level lead the jungle lead is starting to build and yes g2 are
15:00
finding advantages towards the bot side of the map flack head is getting very far ahead but the rest of the map going
15:06
in favor of t1 yeah critical that kumiyoshi did hit six prior to this dive going off right on
15:11
that last minion flashes out looking like hey he might have been able to get away but flaccid connects with the alt
15:16
on carry under the tower finishes them off really nice sidestep from carrier there props to him making it that bit harder for flaca to secure that kill and
15:23
huge props to the t1 bot lane because really that's their first loss of the game in terms of the aggression that
15:29
they've experienced in the bot side of the map they've weathered the storm about as well as they could um but the good news for them is the rest of the
15:35
map is going exceptionally well for t1 so yes gumiyushi you have been attacked
15:40
a lot but the good news for you is you've got faker and zeus sitting in a very comfortable spot they drafted the contingency plan yeah two marksman if
15:47
one is behind the other that's exactly what i was talking about i can also i can feel the size of relief from our
15:52
analysts that are just back there saying oh yeah they always have a plan for if something's being taken across map i
15:58
said that before you know we've been saying it all tournaments meantime there's a fight here towards the bottom side nice side step there from goomba
16:05
youtube still being able to weed through these autos owner turns up as well targamous in trouble but he's going to stay alive for now gummies she's not
16:12
going to be able to find that kill and will be taken down g2 now happy with what they've taken faker moving on in
16:17
it's a blast diego's gonna get handshake out of that opportunity fake is going to pick up the kill as he dives on in and
16:24
he's not going to be over hungry to pick up more of these resets as t1 answer back what a play by carrier though the
16:30
timing on the handshake yanking gankos back here right as faker arrives so t1
16:37
get the return kill they're pushing in and they're eight and oh my god they're so far ahead already for this many
16:44
plates it's more than a kitchen here towards the bottom side is that is gonna be the ulti going wide from carrier
16:49
unfortunately fake a decent sidestep on the wins of war the g2 tidy up the minion wave and then i'm not gonna lose
16:54
too many more of those place bottom lane okay i feel like you know that you know there was a movie about
17:00
bullets bending yeah yeah i feel like all of the skills are just bending around t1 because they're
17:06
sidestepping everything okay it's just it's disgusting to watch how good they are at dodging all of these skills but
17:12
such a well executed early game once again from t1 and you know we talked about it uh yesterday on the answers the
17:17
answer talked about it again today the trying to fight this team in the other game is very difficult thing to do look at how much they're sidestepping
17:24
because we're usually going to see the eq side step that once again and the props to him there's only so much he can do and this much is thrown at him but
17:30
the cheap response from t1 is equally as strong i mean it's incredible right like it should have just been a super easy
17:36
free kill but they're able to avoid the pike hook they're able to avoid the knock-up um we can see in in the replay
17:41
broken blake gonna get away but there is that handshake pulling him back and faker comes in with the gale force
17:47
active gets that kill they secure the dragon i was gonna say eight plates but they made a liar out of me as they grabbed another play top so they're up
17:53
to at least i think nine now at this point yep isaiah's also gonna make it out um before the uh the ward comes down
18:01
so he's going to uh escape unscathed 3-0-0 on the tristana and i love this
18:06
you know because the bottom lane was getting talked up so much coming into msi of course for t1 gumiya shikaria
18:12
best bottom lane in the world i was one of the people on tape saying that and it looks like g2 got the memo they're like
18:17
well we're going to take down this best bottom lane in the world and you know what that means that means fakers 3-0-0
18:22
with a billion farm left completely on his own to wipe out every plate on the
18:28
map it's absurd gets another full tower here on the bottom side of the map before plates go down and it's just such
18:34
a smart pick you know coming into yesterday's series i was thinking if we were gonna see this kind of matchup it would be against xiaohu because he's
18:40
such a galio guy he's known for it you can imagine they were ready for the galio match up right exactly but we
18:45
didn't get to see that and then here you know g2 i think less expected that they would just be slapping down the gallio
18:51
this early but t1 very clearly ready with the game plan it has worked out incredibly well both there marksman now
18:58
on gale force here you can see despite all of the effort to put flaccid ahead kumiyushi is is right up there with him
19:04
he is 600 gold down but he has the same items in inventory right now and t1 have
19:10
opened up a nearly 6 000 gold lead here not even 14 minutes into the game half of that's on faker and the thing i want
19:16
to uh really iterate here is that t1 didn't even do much to set faker up to
19:21
get that it was very much a g2's early game productivity faker was just the recipient of all those bot lane dives
19:28
sure i'll run i'll pick myself up a couple kills oh caps you don't want to be in lane that's fine i'll take your plates i'll take your towers and it's
19:34
literally just been t1 punishing all of the decisions the g2 has been making in this early game and this was one of the
19:40
big concerns i had for trying to match this team in the early game because t1 regardless of what you tried to do to
19:46
them it within the first 15 minutes of the game they have a plan they have a response and they will look to punish
19:51
you for every small mistake you make well canon barrage available here for broken blade but they're not going to go for it faker is going to make it out
19:57
just a rocket jump required as they look for this herald and one of the most impressive things about t1 to me is that
20:03
just through pure laning skill they're often able to get advantages on both sides of the map when it's really supposed to be a trade right you're
20:09
supposed to trade dragons on bot side for herald and a gold lead on top side but t1 is able to outplay in so many
20:15
situations and have so many incredible individuals as far as the laning goes that you know really it was a split map
20:22
bot side advantage for g2 all owner did top was one quick dive and then a left
20:27
left zeus alone and then he was just covering bot on the other side of the map you know he was able to really reduce the advantages that g2 could get
20:34
because he was so efficient with his gang top and so effective with his passing towards bot yeah and this is actually what faker is doing here with
20:40
the mid lane tristana is what we see so many tristanas do it's very similar to why caitlyn is so popular in the lck you
20:46
rotate out to every lane that has a turret that's accessible and you destroy all of them this is something the drx
20:52
was very good at doing uh alongside deft they would just move like is it just a
20:57
demolition demolition machine that's that's all the tristana is supposed to do and then faker hooves up all of that
21:02
money and that trough that we talk about doesn't exist he has 11 items by like 20 minutes in the game and then it is over
21:08
and so far that game plan has been completely unhindered so the thing i now have to kind of bring our attention to
21:14
is this t1 mid game yeah you are quite familiar with that alice um most 20 minutes
21:20
that's why i was getting in all my positives i'm like i'm looking at the club
21:26
that's the thing i want to keep reminding people of course right now tijuan look very much in control and on paper the argument would be this is
21:33
tuwan's game to lose and i think we can all agree with that especially with their position and their ability to siege so the question is can they do it
21:39
cleanly because the criticism and the reason why they looked weaker during the first stage of the rumble was because
21:45
they would get these leads and then they would get overeager to try and force fights they would rush baron they would flip baron became a bit of the meme
21:51
during the rumble stage and so as you transition into this mid game scrutiny and the eyes are going to be on this mid
21:56
game and tion's ability to use this lead to close out the game claim i think one of the most atypical and interesting
22:02
stats from the rumble stage was that every team that took a baron against t1 was actually behind in gold when they
22:08
did it one team took a baron from a head in gold and that kind of speaks i think to some of the problems that they were
22:14
having around baron also the vast majority of the kills against t1 post 20
22:19
minutes also at the barren pit so they definitely had some troubles there but we also saw in the last match that they
22:25
had against g2 they kind of used um some of their their faults at the baron to bait g2 into actually face checking them
22:31
right because everyone was thinking all right well g2 here they here they go t1 over at the bear in time to get a free
22:36
ace and a baron get right back into it and t1 didn't even start it up in that case uh they really played into the fact
22:42
that they had made those previous mistakes so we'll see if they can actually do that again and remain very very clean because they are just
22:48
monstrously ahead 7 000 gold 17 minutes is this relaxing and it's going to take some real playmaking
22:55
from g2 to try to crawl their way back into this one it's a it's certainly a toughy but i was
23:01
going to talk about like the the down 6000 gold power spike for for g2 and things like that but it's you know
23:07
moving ever further uh towards closer to seven right now that is two drakes behind as well as the hextech soul
23:14
coming in i got excited for a moment but then i was unexcited afterwards as the clouds feel the weight in your hair i
23:19
certainly did you know that was the actually i was just breathing i was going to ask you whether you felt
23:25
it as well but it's how you breathe
23:31
yeah i like it i'm really excited
23:42
calm down it's okay say us now it should be able to swag his way out of that one totally fine you can
23:48
see how much control tion have over the map once again g2 is looking for a pick here and there but i don't think targets
23:53
wants to take that fight and i just want to bring attention to the number of towers that are up and available right now there is some a lot of standing gold
23:59
i would say for g2 to grab the question is can they grab it as an ultimate comes in from you yeah that is a category
24:05
great handshake does come through there as caps does try to get out the top but he's not going to be able to find the
24:10
gale force he's going to be able to keep your issue alive caps flashes away but faker just assassinates blacking in the
24:16
back line as well as the resets will come in jankos is lying on the ground and this
24:23
taunt is not going to work the heartbreaker is going to come through but it's going to get taken down caps goes
24:28
golden again at exactly the right time zayus now wrapping around carrier moving in flashes forward doesn't get the
24:34
handshake though has broken blade melee range against this renata but it looks like carrier doesn't really mind zeus is
24:40
so so scary but the top lane they're losing everything this is why i keep casting team fights and the whole base
24:46
is exploding d1 are winning on the other side of the map a very scrappy fight here between g2 and t1 but t1 taking the
24:54
hex skates they grab that top and hib and they are getting further and further
24:59
ahead here really close fight but you can just see the gold lead for faker i mean look look at mid lane it's 5 000
25:07
gold individually ahead there everyone is paper to faker here he's got the bf
25:12
gold he already has his crick cloak so not too far off getting that ie at this point it's
25:18
it's once again a situation where t1 is just the recipient of g2's decision
25:23
making g2 feel pressured and they go to try and make a pick happen the ultimate comes through i mistakenly believe that
25:29
move is a flash for some reason and in any case g2 look at how aggressive they are in the pot lane once again where
25:35
does the storm go she and carrier just buy time and then look at this play from faker the combo was beautiful the flash
25:41
from the hook as well helps secure the kill broken blades not even there to assist and again like t1
25:47
didn't have to do anything there they just responded to the plays being made by g2 and they were the benefactor of
25:54
the play absolutely i mean it's a lot of the plays start to look bad when you're this far down right
25:59
because there's just so few options i respect g2 you know going for that winning play and i think to actually
26:04
play to win in this game you've got to just constantly look for picks hopefully there's mistakes on the t1 side so they go for this aggressive play doesn't
26:11
quite work out for them because t1 is in the area can collapse and really really punish and even the top lane becomes quite
26:17
concerning now when you see the second item is already through there for zeus second item in for gumiyushi albeit a
26:23
with has but he's really kind of back to parity uh and faker only needs a couple hundred gold here for his ie and then uh
26:30
he is just gonna be completely uncontested on the map yeah if he's not already uh at this stage of the game the
26:35
ie does come on through owner also sitt",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lktA6BGAyuA

[Music] aatrox I feel like on red side we're seeing a trucks you'll be kind of like the locked fans these days especially
0:06
against teams like that one but that's going to be a sejuani it's a lot here and I think that might be nugury sejuani we'll see Canyon can also play it if he
0:12
wants to but notary when I watch a place that you want in the lck he always has to push and he always goes for these
0:17
crazy lives it can backfire quite quickly but he does like the pressure in that lane despite being a weak side top
0:24
laner now G2 Lucian Nami is something we've seen behind a lot of success today is that something G2 want to run
0:30
um we've seen the Draven from them didn't really work out Cena seraphine is a G2 classic in keeping their bot Lane
0:35
stable and having really good scaling yep that's a scary one we've actually seen dharmon ban this before uh as well
0:40
not going to be the case this time around gives G2 the option they are going to lock it away and will seraphine
0:46
just follow alongside could certainly be an option could also hold it because it's not likely that
0:52
dumb on Kia are going to pick that one away as a priority we'll give them the uh opportunity
0:58
um to have a little bit of a uh custody battle there on the bottom side with Lucian versus the uh Center so they've
1:04
locked in the center seraphine that's gonna be the flag of Toro gamma special
1:09
how does down one down one respond they pick their bot name here or do they look to focus
3:14
so Silas Victor is still the mid lane pool that we've been seeing coming out Talia is one of those Champs but also we
3:21
picked we saw showmaker play that if they want to play some kind of telly yep see how hard they over index on it
3:28
but for now they have a very strong board game they can play too in their fallback option is to just put Sergio on his top and take a carriage under for
3:33
Canyon seems like it makes a lot of sense the Victor is going to be the ban I was half expecting the Silas just because the
3:40
akali band coming in does kind of scream we want to force pick Silas um may not yet be what uh caps
3:46
decidedness we have that's why it was such a staple pick for G2 because it neutralized bot Lane to the point where
3:51
Target Mass could get a lot of soul scale up to meet the late game and Roamer Alvin helped G2 while the
3:57
seraphine performs in isolation so very very strong tarry top side for G2
4:04
specifically top jungle that they'll need to accelerate but a very tough mid lane matchup to deal with I think for G2
4:09
because the LeBlanc so mobile against the Velvet Swain that'd be very hard to lock him down okay to uh their next
4:14
matches as well but we are ready to jump into the game that one are ready to play G2 are ready to play and one thing I was
4:21
going to highlight actually is the fact that nugury is playing sejuani because he joined this roster in summer and everyone was like the carry is back the
4:27
couple extraordinaires here Sergio is his most played this year and in their
4:32
finals uh in 2020 he played three games of horn so he's no stranger to these tank tops the only problem is I mean you
4:38
can see it already with the ignite he plays him a little bit too aggressively sometimes so he needs to be careful up here and agree if his team's focusing on
4:44
this Lucian Nami Lane not to try to you know what I've seen dive Broken Blade or try to dive near me Top Lane or see how
4:50
much of a leash Nook he's on to try to control himself but broken blame now hovering on this top side yankos behind him I think they were considering some
4:56
kind of top side leads invade there but Hank also back off towards his red buff yep uh nagari actually invented the zero
5:03
two power Spike um in 2020 uh he's definitely not afraid to go aggressive even if it's a really
5:10
bad idea yeah um he's done it many many times and what he does is he creates a lot of pressure around the map that was something that uh someone here used to
5:16
be able to utilize very effectively when they became world champions in 2020 and uh it took them a while to sort of
5:23
figure out what nagri was going to do for the team now that they have docked arm who's far more of a carry player
5:28
towards that bottom side of course it's kind of interesting that they're here across the other side of a center
5:35
because ghost was a phenomenal Center player um that is not the mo of Doc darling
5:40
yeah style changed of course ghosts also a fantastic six player along those lines
5:45
and things like this set up for that one where they could focus on this top side a bit more and have an agree on those carries but memory training wrestling on
5:51
the Broken Blade now who's getting the better hand of those trades and Canyon passing up towards that top side and cause panting down towards the bot Lane
5:57
and of course the Sergio and Diego really good to have a mealy jungler with the seguani to reset those ease to get
6:03
the stuns in and the ward being down there will spot Canyon now it's not for red Raptors drop so we will level up to
6:08
three after this uh yanko's done the exact same thing except Dam ones do not have information yep see what Canyon
6:15
does though well they look very hard to lock down Broken Blade especially with the w with the repost
6:20
just uh putting a lot of pressure on uh towards here certainly something that you'd somewhat expect as caps taking a
6:26
bit of damage but showmaker also taking a bit in return we mentioned the importance of this mid lane it certainly
6:32
is their Winter's wrath not going to find Broken Blade the Fiora doing a great job pushing out on this top side
6:38
we have to remind everyone that uh G2 were fighting for not only themselves but EG's hopes as well in this group
6:45
they require Damon Kia to go 0-3 they have to lose all of their games after
6:51
fg2 are able to win here they then rely on DG themselves it's a tag team really
6:57
isn't it for G2 and the West they'll take down that one first heat you'll take them down second and then hopefully
7:02
jdg can clean it up but that's a that's a long step process you know G2 are the first in line to make this happen it's
7:09
gonna be very very hard though that one look incredibly strong their game against jdg was very competitive so despite that one loss
7:16
we are at here they are here at Worlds to play and a lot of people have them as the dark horse to win the whole
7:21
championships so Canyon now hovering around show maker looking for a kilometer caps yeah the chains are gonna Land There is a vision of Empire just on
7:28
top of cats to deter anyone from sticking around underneath that turret just a lot of extra pressure no Summoner
7:33
spell is going to be blown on either side so all is now calm once again on someone has ripped it is and Broken
7:38
Blade they're pushed in top wave crashed it into the tower took a base ran back out towards top and saved his TP Taps
7:45
under a little bit of pressure here so Target match this is what you do on the center you move towards other lanes help your jungler out take the souls from the
7:51
camps help your soloings push out and take the souls there too Brooke it will freeze this wave which means never will have to TP back but no nugury stays and
7:57
says I'll push this one in these are the kind of risks that nugury often tends to take um his jungler's on Crux right now
8:03
opposite side of the map and he's fighting Broken Blade to try to crash the wave so he might just die we'll have
8:08
to see what happens but he's play he's playing like his genres behind him yeah no he's uh he was playing like his
8:14
jungler was standing right next to him asiancos is now here so it's the opposite of having his jungler in fact
8:19
it's the enemy jungler that's here and he's still here this is nugger in a nutshell really isn't it just still sticking around doesn't want a base in
8:26
TP yet maybe he wants a little bit more gold for his item but he's gonna walk back up here and take a couple more creeps broken has a w up and available
8:33
Canyon's basic but G2 don't know that and that's the information that Greece playing with he's saying maybe Canyon's
8:38
behind me might need to be careful here a little bit yankos deterred from a gank still one Ward will help him out caps
8:43
yet the TP back showmaker similarly and like it has saved his TP still I like
8:48
the bluff put on a bit more pressure than they would otherwise be able to it's a bluff
8:55
that's not necessarily actually real because nagori is going to play the same way no matter what
9:00
um but it is still I guess theoretically the uh goal gonna be completely even as now we're looking for a first blood 2v2
9:06
in the mid lane yanko's gonna zigzag and then zigzag again get himself out
9:11
came out of Base there has the Sheen and the long sword but Yankovic as well he's gonna base whenever he will finally
9:17
crash this top wave after having tped back very slow game from both sides I think both teams are pretty happy with
9:23
it the Lucian Army needs one item Spike number he needs level six if everyone's have kill pressure in this Lane and
9:28
showmaker will always try to threat Midwood Canyon open side for G2 Santa seraphine always likes to scale Swain
9:33
similarly wants to get towards more of a defensive item like the merch threads so he's a little safer in this Lane and
9:39
broken bait will win out in isolation the longer this game goes on team fights will be very interesting though see how
9:44
they play out that one have somewhat front to back but with a LeBlanc Diego or a very flank Skirmish heavy and
9:50
focused on resets and G2 are almost like this death ball with the Wild Card fracture of the Fiora nobody's gonna
9:56
miss the charge there yeah excited up the minion wave quite nicely and yeah I'm glad that you talk about you know
10:02
the scaling aspect both of these Farms certainly okay with the late game but I imagine that if it was infinite time
10:08
into this game Jitsu have a heck of a lot of scaling as we get to you know six
10:13
items and things like that that one definitely wanted to play around this mid game that I think it's going to be
10:19
on caps to try and deny as this game goes on of course two items one item on the Swain certainly can be very very
10:26
powerful yeah that one's mid game stronger g2's full late game is stronger we're looking for broken here see if he
10:32
goes for the E the W won't come out and one of the trading involts yeah fantastic bubble is going to connect there as Target is just going to walk it
10:38
out and off time and Kellen not able to get any kills but are at least putting on a fair bit of pressure also keeping this
10:45
wave underneath the turret wanting to get their first plate if they can mid and Bot will always be the pressure
10:51
point for Damon and they'll always be the leads if they can get kill pressure in if broken leader goes up towards this
10:56
sorry if um Canyon goes up towards his top side tries to shut down Broken Blade then yankos can secure Drakes when not
11:01
having fault push or mid push and that's not what Canyon wants to secure these neutral objectives and then play towards
11:06
top side on the herald spawn we'll see how dumb one fight around that Herald because dragons up they have the bot push they could stop this Dragon right
11:12
now if they want to crash this way but they could also tried to crash the wave together and then base and moves that
11:17
top side so it's on that one to make the first move and G2 to respond see what is going to happen here 100
11:23
gold separates these two teams just looking for our first neutral objective Canyon's just going to walk on over and
11:29
start stabbing it and as you can see jankos in the area of the herald and you mentioned the fact that Darwin Kia have
11:34
two pressure points in bot and mid lane um it'd be great if you could tell nauguri that because he is still trying
11:40
to fight against Broken Blade brand challenge does come out the ignite comes through as well as yankos is going to Zig and zag and try and find his way in
11:46
here does manage to throw nuggery up towards the sky is this going to work out is the question is broken be taken
11:53
down it's a one for one in the Top Lane first play First Blood goes over to Broken Blade but they managed to get the
11:59
Drake on the other side so much damage coming out of that Tower Canyon space will get stopped there yankos cannot do
12:05
the herald caps oh he's in trouble he's going to get rooted but not going to have enough damage to follow this one up
12:10
show maker just going to let him live for now has to heal on the spell book as well so was safe regardless that one
12:16
keeping these both ways pushed into G2 wanted to get that top top dive going but Broken Blade had to crash the wave
12:22
by using his ult initially dashboards gets ignited and he gets pushed out yankos had to drop the tower I grow so
12:28
Broken Blade Falls victim to the death after getting the final Auto attacking so jankos gets the knock up gets it all
12:34
to it I think and then pops the E straight away tries to negate a lot of the damage but he drops to even very
12:39
very quickly and then Broken Blade has to finish him off because tanks the Tower of max range now we've got a Herald start here from the side of damn
12:45
one we'll keep an eye on their bottling here because long time and Canada moving up this River it's like it just
12:51
tp-bought as well so I think still have to give this one up but they're on this top side of the map Target is going to
12:56
be rotating over here as well does have jankos in tow is now cats could be in trouble.com does get the double tap but
13:02
the Demonic Ascension is going to be in there it's not enough though as Kellan locks down that kill now G2 looking to
13:07
get underneath their outer turret in the mid lane this should give Darwin enough control to go back towards this Rift
13:13
Herald that was actually already secured there by Canyon so uh actually did more damage than I expected in a shorter
13:19
period of Time Herald and a kill there's W Brooklyn Nine side step from The Herald and a kill over to that one great
13:25
play their boss Lane moves up towards mid and they're just there to stop G2 from being able to contest but caps overstepping maybe thought he was a
13:31
little bit safer than he initially was because yankos and targamas were around but they were a little bit far away in
13:36
that topside River and weren't able to collapse in time to save him had the heel too but damn won't have enough damage to get the kill cap still has the
13:42
flash so Brooklyn they're trading really hard up in this top side might look for a kill here onto nugury yeah battle Pig
13:48
continuing to get some work done as uh yeah the fade away glacial prison just to make sure that for it gets the
13:53
message yeah showmaker was hovering up towards that top side after mid wave so Broken Blade did not want the chase so let's
14:00
take stock both huge objectives over to that one pressure in mid and bolt still there small lead for Broken Blade but
14:05
nobody's been able to negate a lot of the pressure by training in these one for once next play for damn one is where they use this Herald and yankos looks
14:12
like he wants to build towards that blade of their own King as quick as possible that'll be the spike for the Bell vet and it's just gonna be mid bolt
14:18
Focus all game long for Damon yeah G2 look like they're gonna match it it's feeling a little bit like it's uh
14:24
going the way that G2 want it to though right because it's still underneath a uh 1000 gold lead and we're just trying to
14:31
get towards that late game 4-1 and potential team fighting to try and get them across the line I
14:37
wonder if they can stack the Drake's definitely scary as now a bit of an attack towards that bottom side drop down very far up as targetmus slinks
14:44
into the Mist vision of Empire doesn't find Colony throws down the heel just to get them out and now the rest of the
14:50
Cavalry have arrived showmaker trying to dash after caps there puts him on the
14:56
leash and he is going to get rooted down but not going to be able to uh get any kills on Swain here is running so fast
15:02
demonically ascends here as doctum is their target can he actually get it though is the question there is The
15:07
Flash away from the never movers Canyon gets knocked up they're not gonna get taken down and now Darwin is it their
15:13
turn to try and go on the offensive showmaker throws down another chain connects it but it's broken immediately
15:19
caps now just trying to get back towards this mid lane as showmaker distorts but defensively no one dies nobody dies in
15:28
that exchange it looked like doktam was gonna fall but he flashes away the turn onto caps was very close but incredibly
15:33
tanky Merc tricks Giants spelled on his first buys and yeah that was all coming
15:39
from a lane gank G2 never really locked down the bot Lane of that one they dodged basically every spell and fleckett was holding on to that seraphin
15:46
ultimate because Gotham has the cleanse not we're looking for a plate here and he's gonna get it so actually getting the better Handler broke played right
15:51
now Broken Blade really needs that Divine Thunder and starts fighting back capsule push up mid could probably take a base here and TP back but that one
15:57
aren't done on the spot side Canyon's getting the wave in looks like they want to drop the Herald it was uh yeah decent time there so
16:05
needed to make sure that he got rid of it as soon as possible so three plates going to be picked up here in this
16:10
particular push someone gonna be very happy about it Kellen also getting a bit of money for himself as well
16:17
so yankos will go up towards this top side and take the red I think he's just waiting for the blade of their own King
16:22
this play was basically inevitable from Damon the second they picked up the buff and that's what I want to highlight here is looking at showmaker's build with the
16:28
TP and the Lucidity boots I think a lot of pressure hang on a second there it is okay uh Broken Blade you
16:35
can't repost and ignite and that is just a solo Kill from the pig well that's a
16:40
counterpick top into a first pick sejuani and nugury is now solo killed Broken Blade will get another plate in
16:47
this matchup will get another wave in will be ahead and experience will team fight better so this side Lane's just
16:53
falling apart for G2 yeah that's uh that's a battle ball right there um wasn't expecting it
16:59
now Broken Blade in a real rough spot I can say two one and zero now the nugury
17:06
it's only going to get stronger notary in team fights his job was just to weather the storm and tried to go even as best as he can trades one throne in
17:13
the dive gets a solo kill and now he's got his Mythic already broken mate has the Divine sunderer but this is the
17:20
second dragon that's spawning no tp's on either top laner broken leg peep he's back to the Top Lane to push out it's a 4v4 again 4v4 stare down
17:27
for both of these teams no mythics completed on the side of g2s for before but doktam has the gale force and the
17:33
charade to Durkin a lot of pressures on Dogtown to carry through on this game Canyon's on a carry yes and we'll look for resets but and showmaker also
17:39
set ups this game is going to connect to the tidal wave followers through and Canyon he's gonna
17:45
walk down that kill can he find more he's going to be the question well shockbreaker to get himself out of showmaker Dives forward and G2 not going
17:51
to be able to contest this Drake now great setup there by Kevin really really good bubble across the wall into the
17:57
tidal wave easy follow-up for Doc dams culling and that's another kill over through that one that's another Dragon
18:03
over the damn one that might be a ball Tower over to Damon everything going in their favor yeah this is all of a sudden
18:09
become a very difficult game for G2 and it felt like the early game was relatively close there are a lot of
18:15
Trades that were quite even but ever since uh you know that mid lane play with the Herald
18:22
foreign very happy to press as many buttons as
18:27
you would like yeah and the pressure point of the map was this top side but it's just Fallen apart since the solo kill yankos is around but I don't know
18:34
if they can even get buggery down on a kill here he's actually playing with respect nugury in the ltk would be
18:40
jumping on top of that Fury looking for a kill on his ignite coming up but he's actually playing quite far back waiting
18:45
for his team to come out of Base but the igniters now back up he has a lot of kill pressure onto this Fiora if he can
18:52
get the repost so I'm not ready to go for the solo kill yet again and I wasn't actually
18:59
expecting him to play with that much respect he does have a control Ward uh in that bottom brush and he's normally
19:04
pushing the enemy turret you know no matter what without any Vision as we're gonna check this one out one more time the double bubble just beautiful yeah
19:11
just beautiful into tidal wave into the coming into the vehicle he's down and you see on the picture and picture on the bottom right that's a tower for
19:18
nugury into 1v1 isolated he's gonna pick that one up and with the Top push down one feel confident enough to start up
19:24
this Herald they have the mid push from Doc Dam as well I think we're gonna Dash forwards here in a lot of trouble as
19:30
that's a good knock-up there from jankos gets the flash out of showmaker as well Title Wave is good Encore doesn't find
19:36
the mark and in the meantime Canyon is just gonna stick on that Rift Herald they go for it try to make the play but
19:42
don't quite get there kill maker invests The Flash in here good exhaust he's going to come
19:48
through caps throws that one out now Damon looking for a bit of a Siege they have the rift Herald here as well Shirley's going to come down and try and
19:54
knock down that turrety yeah teleport does come through and nuggery's going to turn up as well and now darman's just
20:00
going to Brute Force this outer turret can they get another charge is going to be the question good knock-up knock up onto Daft dumb as they do manage to get
20:06
the charge oh the glacial prison is fantastic at the same time but with docked on being CC you're not able to
20:12
actually follow through you can see the power of Damon's 5v5 just lock down one target the LeBlanc and Lucian can follow
20:19
up so quickly with their single Target damage to get that Target down they're not actually done here yankos and caps
20:24
have based it's a five versus two under this Tower Damon will pick it up and I think they'll be able to get out as well
20:30
no TPS for G2 to force the play no real hard engage either their best form of engage is just caps running forward with
20:36
a seraphine and a center alt on top of him so that one gets so many objectives Four Towers to zero broken middle
20:43
pushing top but nugories just in time to catch the wave yep full health gonna walk on over there he's absolutely fine showmaker also paying a visit to caps
20:50
does connect a lot of chains but fair bit of tankiness here on the side of the Swain play gets the turret but will he
20:57
be able to get out is the question Dawning Shadow flies through there's the flash out for Broken Blade now trying to find these weak points as well gets the
21:04
heel he's just chilling on the outside edge but it's just not going to be enough not very picks up the kill in the
21:09
end and he also has an ulti available to lock down placard Canyon grabs that kill
21:14
and now showmakers here knock-up comes through onto yankos he's not able to return the favor himself as Canyon
21:20
playing a pretty good seraphine here as he locks down the kill on the Bell Beth and Doc Tom gets the kill Damon collapsed too quickly G2 broken mate
21:27
wants to get that top tier one and flackett thought they could look for the turret in the 2v2 with his teleport broken bed gets the vitals and the
21:34
ultimate off but the healing just wasn't enough and in comes showmaker in comes Canyon and kellen's tidal way was
21:40
fantastic doesn't have the evolved form so he can't jump over the walls and that one pick up easy kills objective Bounty
21:48
or with G2 this early on that's what he was focusing on but Canyon on the collapse and just watching mid lane here talk time and Kellen pushing the wave
21:54
they then move up 10 olds keep score from being alive for a little bit longer so he can rock these
21:59
ultimate charges manages to get a little bit of healing but notary just instantly gets that killed yeah it was uh it was
22:06
pretty close I did to believe for a moment there that uh ultimately just wasn't quite enough and just always
22:13
being able to have that first move on the side of Damon
22:18
not enough here yeah yeah now damn one with this big gold beat seven to one in Kill score gonna
22:24
push into this both side secure their third dragons put them on Soul points and we'll say it again if jitu lose
22:30
they're out of the world championship they'll still have another game left to play but it won't actually mean anything and this will also mean that EG is out
22:37
um so damn one and JG will be our teams going through and they'll be playing last at the end of the day and that one
22:43
pushing involt here looking for this bolts here too doctor pushing in mid will rotate across uh capsule catches
22:48
Midway pasta TP if you want to join his team Broken Blade yeah he is just gonna get chain cc'd here finally gets their
22:54
post off but a lot of just random AOE damage being thrown down here it's very
23:00
difficult to stick around underneath his turret especially with showmaker available Encore is still there
23:07
but uh it's just very very hard here for G2 we mentioned the power of Damon Kia
23:12
in this mid game well that has only increased now that that mid inner turret fell down
23:18
exactly what dumb one needed to be able to put the screws in on this game and they are definitely not letting up mid
23:24
game is so strong for their conclusion Nami on two items the viego at level 11 the sejuani Frontline who actually won
23:31
the lane that one are just out classing G2 right now and they're gonna pick up that dragon that just spawns both waves
23:37
are coming in they're slowly chipping down this Tower and G2 really want to defend it oh the Cap's gonna get caught
23:42
out there's a tidal wave the bubbles gonna follow up as well he does manage to go golden the stock Dom needs to use
23:47
the heel to get himself out show maker waiting to strike waiting for his opportunity in the meantime I mean Canyon just wasn't there as well as not
23:54
very sort of three versus four is Broken Blade holding down the forward in the mid lane that one have a lot of sustain
24:00
with the Nami and the red buff on the Lucian they're just going to keep pushing in these midwives going towards both keeping up the 4-1 broke play tried
24:06
to break their setup there by proxing up that mid wave in front of dam one but they won't allow him to do that Canyon
24:11
will be the one split pushing I think the sejuani is stronger in the group because of the hard engage if blackhead walks up here
24:17
he'll get hit by Sergio well there it is not exactly going to find it as The Encore also goes wide Darman Kia just
24:23
using that as a zoning off the inner turret falls down now but showmaker gonna have to try and get out of here broken play doesn't get the repost not
24:29
out of the woods just yet though it should make a finally distorts to get himself out yankos very very close to death his Canyon finds himself the back
24:36
line can he get the reset though is the question the answer is absolutely not but still it is so much damage from
24:42
Darwin Kia they are so far ahead and caps just couldn't do enough belveth also going to fall down has now Broken
24:48
Blade just trying to Lunge his way out of this it's not going to be enough the chase potential just too high from Damon
24:56
Kia repost comes in showmaker says he doesn't mind four for one for down one
25:01
canyon tried to get the killer the back end of the fight manages to get it but doesn't get the reset someone can't translate this into anything because on
25:07
the wrong side of the map before the baron start but G2 have no chance in these fights whatsoever damn one just
25:13
rolling over them right now and I think when they come out of Base they'll start setting up this Baron flackett misses the Encore there is talk that dashes
25:20
away showmaker almost dies here because Broken Blade manages to park a couple vitals then W's on to uh notary to get
25:27
the stun Captain G2 just decide that this is the only fight that they can win Canyon behind manages to kill Target
25:32
Mass trades into a one through one but from this point onwards thuggery's just too tanky and dump them is just too
25:38
strong yeah just able to provide as much space as Darwin would like I really like
25:43
the Relentless Pursuit Flash from docked on to get rid of the priority targets and lock this one down really does feel
25:50
a little bit like dotting eyes and Crossing tees here for dumb on care as they push in the rest of these waves
25:56
this is a great being able to step up and just carry through Games Delivery paying tanks
26:01
gives him a couple more Styles he's just dead I think he is going to be able to mitigate a lot of that damage but it's
26:06
not enough tidal wave comes through Broken Blade doesn't have enough for posts in him in order to keep himself alive as it's a double kill picked up
26:13
here for Canyon it's just transforming into every member of G2 right now this inner turret gonna get taken that is six
26:19
turrets to one in favor of domunk here and they can just go back towards this Baron if they'd like and I don't think
26:25
there's going to be any answer especially without yankos on the map yeah this game is as good as done over a
26:30
10 000 gold lead Baron secured sold up in two minutes time and I was just touching on the styles that damn one
26:37
I've shown us they've shown nugury on Champions like Cumberland Jay so far this world and seems to work now they're
26:42
showing agree on tanks and Dogma being the one carrying through with showmaker on this LeBlanc
26:53
I love it he's three levels up right now against his Fiora winning on Side Lane winning the lane winning in team fights
26:59
and there's an infinity edge picked up for knockdown 60 crit coming through G2 I mean their comp is good at 50 minutes
27:07
into the game but that one's mid game is just so much stronger and they're just steamrolling over them taking absolutely
27:12
every Tower in their team fights are just so much better now that it's gonna push in to look for the end the safe option here for damn one is to turn
27:18
towards a dragon in the next minute while they have the setup in the lanes while they have the push in G2 basically
27:24
have one last fight as a Hail Mary we're gonna look at this top dive again yankos tried to step up to clear the wave pops
27:29
the E here to try to get a little bit of damage reduction to live through it but Canyon gets the kill get three cent turns into Belle meth and that means a
27:36
pretty damn good Velvet he has to take down a double kill and then gets another reset yep I believe his time spent in uh
27:42
velvet home was actually quite low um still looking pretty good
27:47
as dominant yeah just trying to keep G2 away from this Dragon pit but honestly feels like they could just
27:54
start sieging on this turret especially with the baron available showmaker Dives forward oh my goodness Broken Blade just
27:59
getting ripped to shred stopped arm is so strong caps not as tanky as he wants to be right now but he is going to
28:05
survive for the moment Siege minion going to be there in the meantime Canyon splitting in that mid lane as well they
28:11
will be able to take that down as well as the bot inhibitor and then move back towards the streak if they would like to
28:18
30 seconds on the spawn they want to play through mid G2 I think
28:26
they need to talk down oh dear that's just gonna get exploded that's the Lucian damage here the repost is decent
28:31
but he doesn't have it available for black and Broken Blade now has their own cooldown so he's just dead a dou",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9ECM-LU7AA
blue,T1,ZEUS,ONER,FAKER,GUMAYUSI,KERIA,red,FNC,WUNDER,RAZORK,HUMANOID,UPSET,HYLISSANG,T1,"0:00
so maokai is up Yumi is up what does fnatic fan away here
0:06
um of course I think with these bands we might see akali Silas as the mid laner is a little bit Skirmish heavy if you're
0:12
a band yumi's available is T1 just gonna slam it oh boy so FedEx must have a good
0:18
answer to this you don't just give Yumi over no right side they must have an answer we'll see what it is and whether
0:24
it is good enough but maokai is open orange opened that was The Fanatic special against C9 in their first game
0:29
top jungle good engage yeah just can get counterfeit quite easy by things like trundle and so we'll see what they opt
0:34
into but Zeus is urinal off the board and when there's taunting Zeus here with the Jacks a little bit so it's gonna be
0:40
the Lucian Nami here for fnatic okay this one's one of those aggressive answers into something like a Yumi you're saying you can't give it away for
0:46
free you gotta have a plan you gotta be ready they're saying all right we're just gonna push bottom we're gonna threaten these guys keep that pressure
0:52
on yep there's the maokai as well so they will pick the Nami up on three they know T1 can't take away the NAMI so pick
0:58
up the maokai to deny this may as well makes a lot of sense so what does T1 pick here with the Yumi will we see
1:04
severe Yumi I think that's the most common real pairing um and then what could they pick jungle I think trundle
1:10
is another one of them considering to maokai we saw that last game from C9 but sejuani very high priorities tournament
1:15
as well in terms of big bang massive massive tank there in that sejuani and as you were predicting sivir Yumi will
1:22
be the duo to go up against the Lucian Nami sivir has that scaling power she has that wave clear and then the Yumi
1:29
just being able to attach for even more full speed even more buffing I hate that cat everyone hates that everyone shout
1:37
out to medic for providing numerical analytical reasons why Yumi is bad bad
1:42
to play against not bad I just need to find a bug for her as well and then we're all happy yeah we just checked the boxes baby but now we're checking the
1:48
boxes for the bands here in the second half of the draft it will be the Jacks banned by fnatic they want to keep that
1:55
one away from Zeus do you think it's going to be just pure Top Lane Focus or switched up a little bit so a couple
2:00
oceans here the maokai's are flicks they could pick Oren here fnatic as well and just play the maokai on run back but with the bands on mid lane so far Mages
2:07
if leblanc's down and if things like orianna are down as well I wonder what the midday matchup will be Silas akalia
2:14
the next one that I think of lissandra is another one that could work as well but with Jack's Camille bands I think
2:19
Wonder either wants or maokai or Nar something along those lines and then they'll probably counter pick
2:25
mid the sejuani of course is a flex for T1 Zales has a couple games under his belt owner doesn't really have any in
2:32
summer but I don't think it's a champ that he'd be unfamiliar with just really on a pair that sejuani jungle with things like renix and things like said
2:38
something that could work really well on melees that's why it's a bit easier to put a top but the Remington band is coming out from T1 tonight after one
2:45
alright so three top laners banned away in the second half of the draft and there it is you're talking Silas to Kali
2:51
fnatic are immediately ready to go locking that one in and it also leaves the maokai still available as a flex I
2:58
think galio or Silas here could work quite well for T1 unless they want to Pivot to Alessandra but the reason I
3:03
don't like lisandra is because you're playing with the sejiwani the Sandra seguani is so one dimensional in being able to counter the play
3:10
oh it could be zeusione yeah or it could be fake for your name
3:16
either way I'm ready for this oh yeah and Silas would work really well as
3:22
another melee to facilitate that sejuani jungle we expect and it is going to be the Sila sakali matchup skill matchup a
3:29
lot of skill expression individual outplays in the mid lane melee Champs across the board now it's on fnatic
3:35
where is this maokai going is it going top into the yone do you have a counter picking to the Ona here Wonder um or is it just gonna be the maokai top
3:42
and pick something like a Jarvan four could also be a Carly top actually now that I think about it yeah but it won't
3:48
it won't be yeah it'll be the poppy jungle and it'll be um it'll be the maokai top here so Wonder running back the same champ
3:54
um and the poppy makes sense into the dashes from Champions like Silas sejuani as well you it always feels so good
4:01
playing that Poppy to be up against something that you can really shut them down with a steadfast presence interrupt
4:07
those dashes there a little bit both sides having a giant meatball on the front line there as well to tank up play
4:13
front to back if they need to I just love the fact that we're getting to see what you described as a very skill
4:20
matchup but I mean it looks like we might just have Silas and topside and yone versus akali in mid oh they sold back now
4:29
yeah yeah yeah but having a skill match up with Faker and humanoid this is
4:36
Banger guaranteed my friend oh it is indeed and we let's not forget when T1 first debuted on the world stage here
4:42
this year against EDG they were playing Fiora Silas with the Yumi now they've got yone Silas with Yumi and they
4:47
steamrolled EDG with a simile and it was razorque on the poppy upset hilly on the Lucian NAMI so they've got a similar
4:54
Foundation to their initial draft but that's a Yumi and that's Carrie as Yumi with a lot of melee Champs on the top
4:59
side for T1 komyushi very comfortable on the Savior will display to scale you always see any early game Shenanigans is
5:05
a question but I could look for some kind of late invade you know sejuani quite weak on the level one Yumi similarly despite the combat Summoners
5:11
but with the five points on both sides I don't think there'll be any early game level one invades yep five points spread
5:18
line of scrimmage just gonna make sure nobody's trying to do anything too sneaky here early on we can see junglers
5:25
both hovering around that top side of the map means I'm expecting a red start for both the red star blue start excuse
5:31
me and then working from top to bottom I'm excited to see how active these guys
5:37
get in the early game you were talking about Focus around the mid lane the thing is about this skill matchup it's a double melee skill match up there's a
5:43
lot of opportunities for a properly timed gank to really swing some things definitely and both starting top side
5:49
gonna pass towards the bot as you highlight it early Wards on the exact same bus on the pixel from the side of
5:55
fantic and T1 but that Ward on the Raptors entrance will spot out where wrestler is starting could go Raptors right into both side
6:02
here but it's also very common to just go Raptors and then full clear to bolt leave red buff up we'll see what he does face rush for the top Jungle of fnatic
6:09
and I think winner will have a little bit of a hard time against hang on a second ignite dropped on to upset they're just immediately going in at
6:15
level one against this Lucian Nami with the two combat Summoner spells and how
6:21
weak Champions are at level one they're saying okay you've got an aggressive Duo but we got a chance to just jump on you
6:26
here early yeah and trying to contest a push here there's a couple more minions there for fnatic and they have got to
6:32
sustain on both sides with these enchanters melee match up mid means a lot of contests and we expect there to
6:38
be action top side but it looks like that'll be in isolation for now until a couple more levels come through for the yone level six there's a lot of kill
6:44
pressure on this top side for either side and humanoid really aggressive on to Faker right now who will pop the
6:49
potion T1 actually get the both push in isolation I think they forced it out with the ignite playing aggressively
6:54
stepping up so cool they're always willing to trade oh yeah I love this and that's kind of
7:00
how this match up and works in a sense contesting creeps also always become so hard humanoid has no W here oh Faker has
7:05
gone in humanoid in trouble he's walking towards the wrong way the Flash's gonna work human only what an outplay Baker's
7:13
still chasing up there he gets first blood but he dies doing it wow so Hubert actually dashes
7:20
back in there on top of Faker with the shuriken then flashes upwards and Pops the W so he can't get Auto attack good
7:27
mechanics coming out of the FedEx mid laner manages to turn it into a one for one but like you said that's first blood for Faker Silas the failed Flash from
7:34
owner there was it what ended up costing them I do believe that's what made that
7:40
chase last as long as it did now razdark invading gonna find owner there in his jungle Faker has teleported back to the
7:46
mid lane as has humanoid business will continue there razark immediately going in manages to just Instagram that crab
7:53
before owner can interfere flash slam just beating the hell out of
7:58
him but it ain't gonna work because yumi's there to save the day owner getting away now but gumayushi's got to
8:04
be careful razor can fnatic still leading the way this is what they need to be doing kumayushi throwing out the
8:12
boomerang flashing away from the wall stun and T1 Retreats brassarc had no
8:18
bolt push but he's playing with no fear as well manages to get the heal out of kumayushi Trades his flash for it but
8:24
then he gets gumushi's flash on the back end if it owners red buff is still up and Razor's gonna start it up he's
8:29
calling hilasank he's still the mini map he's calling his support to help him out to secure this human it has a little bit of mid push too I think owner knows that
8:35
this is being taken away from him needs to be very careful not to face check his way into this red side because hilisang
8:40
spots him on that Ward over the Crux and Razzle can pick up the red a lot of trading back in mid-humino trying to get
8:45
this wave in probably gonna look for a base afterwards oh maybe a dive hex flash on the poppy of course
8:51
hilly could flash over as well wouldn't surprise me if he does there you go [Applause]
8:57
he's down fnatic I said I wanted to see moves at a resort and we're getting them
9:03
oh we definitely are now look at the minimap as well the amount of wards that are littered in that bot side jungle
9:09
from fnatic as well as the play mid just allows them to be able to push owner out of his jungle push comushi and carrier
9:15
back hex flash over these walls stun Faker into the tower and now humanoids are Carly similar two kills has picked
9:21
up that Oblivion orb the dark seal he will be contesting the midways and of course in a mealy versus melee matchup it makes it so hard for Faker to step up
9:28
this all comes off the back of humor actually trading the one for one initially so he can fight back and get the push when he comes back to Lane very
9:35
very good stuff for fnatic having two kills on an akali early everybody who's played League of Legends has played
9:42
against fatakali at some point everybody knows it feels like the guy is just protagonist status at that point but
9:48
razor is gonna find Faker here in the river humanoids coming to help him razzler continues his Chase Baker's
9:55
trying to get out goes into the Drake pit Hilly's coming around now too Faker fighting back using the Drake knocks
10:02
back to make sure he makes his Escape that was really smart by Faker he pulls the dragon to push razorque away because
10:08
two things will stop him one the the poppy W if he times it perfectly he can stop him dumping over the wall and the stun into the wall so Faker good
10:15
pull of the Dragon there is the upside helmet breath for a second Dash forwards but he's not in range of gumayusi not
10:20
quite that 500 range on the Lucian is a little bit limiting they have that very far forward Ward there in the second
10:26
brush but T1 just now gonna have Faker going up into the brush but fnatics bringing
10:32
down more men too razor shows up nice steadfast presence to stop Faker from
10:37
getting there I would love to see midwave right now I think it's frozen Faker is bleeding minions so it actually ends up crashing into the tower but look
10:43
at this yes lead right now for humanoid oh yeah level six to level four Faker is very close to leveling up but that's a
10:49
full level lead right now for humanoid offset going in for gumayushi takes him down to 100 HP he'll stay alive they get
10:58
that wave pushed up it doesn't fully crash upset and hilly you'll be able to clear these out you can see how violent
11:04
this game is getting around this bottom half of the map again level six level four though like you said Faker is
11:09
suffering in this 1v1 he really is you'll manage to level up but really far behind in creeps humanoid is actually
11:16
quite close to level seven right now so Faker needs to recover very far down in
11:22
creeps down in Gold down an experience and all comes up the back of razorque finding him as he roams in that ball side jungler might find him again you
11:29
know has the hex flash humanoid we'll see if he fast pushes his wave in with his cues but no resolution to go over towards the blue buff and owners coming
11:35
out of Base razor knows his window here should be able to pick this one up and the top crab as well Zeus has had
11:40
contestant Top push but I don't think he'll be able to leverage it to collapse onto razzark in time and this is another
11:46
hit on Faker indirectly Silas versus akali energy Champion versus Mana Champion Faker not being able to spam
11:52
spells as much with no blue Razor's still hurting him going after this Scuttle crab now his smite's on cooldown
11:58
so owner can just walk up slap that one away steal that one away and razor has to walk on home but he's still happy
12:04
taking that blue he's indeed happy that's working on hovering around mid maybe he's just
12:09
trying to look to slow Faker down hold the wave a bit so that he might can catch it before it lands on the tower we'll see a few more pushes and looks
12:15
for roams around the map Baker taking his base every time we look down here on this pop side there's a little bit of trading up so it always wants to dash
12:21
forwards and he can win the waves in a bit of a more stable State you don't want to dash into that many minions you'll always lose out on the trade as
12:27
soon as Yumi pull coming through razzler about to Ticker with level six owner simile there's the dashboard actually okay upset getting the culling but into
12:35
the minion wave go most of the bullets kumiyushi recognizing he needed to take cover immediately
12:41
and they'll get this wave pushed up even further back in mid it's still humanoid with a massive Farm lead and more
12:46
minions to pick up fakers got to try to find Opportunities elsewhere owner's gonna start up the herald but there is a
12:52
ward in the pit from fnatic they are sending razor down say who's coming over now too hilly is coming up from bottom
12:58
Lane there is no movement from anybody in the bottom Lane of T1 Harold still at about 3 000 down to 1500 now razor still
13:06
looking to fight still looking to contest owner will it be a Smite fight it is secured T1 have the objective
13:11
nobody picked up the eye he got the eye but he'll die for it t1's jungler
13:17
flashing over the wall you're dead bro what the hell resourc matches the Flash
13:22
and gets the kill I think the idea was Flash out glascon and then Harold's recall maybe there was some Shenanigans in his head of how he could Escape
13:28
opposite have to give up a bolts wave there and loses a plate because healing roamed towards mid they're pressuring the mid tier one here wrestler knows
13:34
that owners both sides jungle is up there looking for camps down here plates as much as possible they're actually not even looking for the dragon just yet so
13:41
finally come out ahead with a kill but owner still gets the herald hey that Herald on average is worth two plates
13:46
fnatic just got two plates that evens out and they're feeling good about getting another kill they get the flash
13:53
out of the sejuani so less play-making ability from that one of course it does cause the flash from razzler as you pointed out too but this is a 25 CS lead
14:01
for humanoid now Faker is gonna struggle to catch up a little bit you would have to think Baker's been dropping waves
14:07
ever since he got Dove mid by the humanoid razorque at line level five he's not really been able to find anything here so human would fast pushes
14:13
mid because faker's giving up the wave to get here first then owner manages to get the Smite I think it's the eye that he hits we'll see what happens in the
14:20
slow mo managed to win out on the Smite fight it looks like razzler pushes owner into
14:25
window to get the CC chain Zeus has to ult out to avoid the maokai old himself and I think owner he wants to flash over
14:30
blascon over to Crocs and then just recall on the spot with the herald but razak managed to flash over the auto attack gets the kill and then back to
14:36
life trying to get the first dragon in the game fnatic have been an awesome look here in the early game three to one
14:43
and kills they got themselves at first Drake 10 minutes in the gold however is still very close there's the sejuani
14:50
ulti not quite enough range but the flash to follow gumayushi gets paid
14:57
so that's a kill onto the Savior that'll help out both a little bit hilly gets
15:03
rooted into the Sergio slow so he has no way out of it flash flash trade Top Lane has just been a bit of a struggle for
15:08
wondering isolation yeah she really wants to play its owner might even drop the herald here if they want to look for a full tower razzorax here to cover no
15:14
teepees on the phonetic solo Lanes humanoid could try to collapse if he wants to with this huge level lead but looks like he's staying around mid so
15:21
plates funneled into the silver actually the knockback will bite can they stop
15:26
this Herald from crashing is the question it's a 3v3 as of now humanoid still has not moved Harold has to get
15:32
through this wave you'll have a little bit of firing time on it T1 aggressively pushing this up
15:38
they really want this crash level up is going to happen now too okay I honestly I love the attempt there from fnatic and
15:45
from razorc but it's not going to pay the dividends they wanted the Herald's gonna get the two plates bottom Lane
15:51
turret barely hanging on and T1 go up by about 700 gold fire on a gold lead on
15:57
the 80 carry roll there for gumushi will be able to get towards his Mythic a little bit quicker than upset we know the power of the Lucian gale force when
16:02
the Nami has mandate as well that's the big spike for that lane but still a little bit far away because of the charade that Derek as well so humanoids
16:09
had so much mid-push and he's up so many creeps but he's not actually transferring his pressure to both there I wondered if the akali could move down
16:14
here to threaten the 4v3 to stop the herald upset it's gonna chunk out camushi a little bit but no fuel
16:19
pressure there yep gumayushi's just able to walk that one all the way back off fnatic in this bottom Lane the Lucian
16:26
Nami the one item power Spike where they start to feel so fearsome that's when I want to really see some of that kill
16:32
threat coming out as gumiyushi still has 23 minions left to go on that call before he's going to get a gold infusion
16:38
and now let's see if they can get hilly again there's no flash available the boomerang blade comes out the spell
16:44
shield roughly time upset both Summoner spells to get away owner always hovering balti
16:50
knows his win condition on this on the spot size they can't win the 2v2 minutes is doing so fine in isolation and
16:56
shutting him down won't really Ned's fnatic that much because it's your tank top jungle razzock might be able to Smite this one away oh yeah easy money
17:02
there just joink it right from over the wall Zeus won't get that and then back here in mid razor again looking for an
17:09
opportunity potentially onto Faker owners around but there's no sejuani ulti so fnatic have actually sent Wonder
17:15
bolt he actually tped on that Tower to save it it's to stop gomuchi from Beyond to pick it up and then upset base and
17:20
ran towards top they're trying to mismatch the lanes here to put their tank into the server to deny any kind of Dives but I think um usually will then
17:27
run top to match solution when he sees upset because tonight want to avoid the T1 bot Lane as much as possible I think
17:32
they know that they're losing out on the 3v3 right now and upset still needs that gale force and if we're talking mythics
17:39
you can see right there on the left side of your screen the first one completed there for gumayushi the Kraken Slayer on
17:44
the sivir for plenty a DPS back here in mid owner just trying to help Faker get this wave shoved up a little bit Baker
17:51
down almost 35 CS in this mid lane matchup as razorque walking through that
17:56
top side River he has his bottom Lane and support right next to him owner knows he can't contest this he does
18:02
indeed and now T1 of even up the lanes they've matched the states that they've wanted they've put Zeus back into wonder they put gumushi back into upset look at
18:08
upset Summoners no flash no cleanse if sejuan is even around or in the top Rush he's basically dead so they have to give
18:14
up a lot of this push it's humanoid that's holding panic in this is humanoid with this big lead as he just highlighted that can push in waves and
18:20
move whenever fnatic need him so that'll be their Band-Aid for the
18:25
side lane differences right now and one minute on the dragon I wonder if T1 decides to swap back because now kamyushi is moving mid and Faker is
18:32
moving top a lot of Lane movement coming in here but Zeus will get the Grump Isaiah's going in wants to steal it away
18:39
just fighting against wander snaps right back to where he began this yone in isolation you've been talking about the
18:45
advantages he's built it just feels so good to get a meatball to just beat on your free farming you do whatever you
18:51
want and he scales up for free as a champion that is just absolutely frightening with a couple of items yeah
18:58
especially with Yumi on his back we'll see if he can get that 203 item Spike on the Ona and shut down the carries all
19:03
fnatic wonder will be more of a front line team fight utility not really expected to win the lane 30 seconds on
19:09
this track and how does Panic play this out because humanoids our strongest member but he's on his top tier one and with no TP so T1 could opt to the 4v4 I
19:17
think they're much stronger in that sense just about mid push and who can get the objective first AOS will pick up
19:22
this Tower but there's no wave behind him needs to be careful yeah I think he overestimated how quickly he could take
19:27
that down there had to spend the Fate seal to get back out Wonder flashing forward flash for Flash there as Zeus
19:34
walks his way out he'll pay for that one a little bit classic window drops the lap the seconds he was flashed away
19:39
we'll see if he tries to stop his base here because Drake is spawning sales will be able to TP back to this ball tier one humanoid is now moving from the
19:45
top side it looks like no hang on a sec he's going back to the Lane but shieldbow picked up for Zeus exactly that's the critical thing right there
19:51
this item giving so much more survivability in a team fight where he could otherwise be focused down more
19:56
easily and now the Drake the hex tech Drake nine percent attack speed and nine
20:01
ability haste he's gonna feel nice no matter what Champion you're playing fnatic of course got that first ocean Drake for themselves the score is tied
20:08
three to three the gold favors T1 by nearly 2K Zeus going in this time with
20:14
soul Unbound to make sure nothing bad happens look at the Gold lead in top 1.5 K in isolation first break over to Zeus
20:23
both mid laners have TP on this top side dragon is up both bot Lanes coming out
20:28
of Base as well I think both teams want to contest this Dragon the easy play for fnatic could be just to drop the dragon
20:33
and then move towards Herald if T1 tries to contest but they're gonna start this one up opposite's coming out of Base there's a TP from Faker on both way if
20:39
you'll match with Zeus on the far side as a flank owner might come down here as well communicate a little bit splits
20:44
Will Group up with his team now finally could just decide let's go Harold we've got their TP let's try to get their top tier one and cross map
20:50
but that'll deny a second dragon from them midwave contest coming in so no dragon taken by either side owners
20:57
got carrier attached to him so he'll move back down towards the Drake now and okay T1 are just gonna go for this
21:03
humanoid is top but he has a Teleport fnatic don't seem to be wanting to commit that to this razzler's gonna walk
21:10
up and try to see if he can steal this one away Papi ulti came through Drake is secured razor jumps into Faker human
21:17
always made his way into the fight now Faker just instantly dead not looking good there as wondering humanoid looked
21:24
awesome steal his fate humanoid is down and sales tries to fight but he falls next
21:31
Wonder Burns away to the ignite as gumayushi looks for hilusang upset dashes back over the wall and owner is
21:38
ready for the flash follow cleanse gets upset away brazord tries to rejoin with his bottom laners owner goes in and
21:46
hilly tries to flash he'll Escape for now the solo let us fall on both sides
21:51
it's the jungle books that fight to the death T1 trying to chase fnatic down there they might just get a lot of
21:56
Summoners out of the fnatic squad but it's Zeus who turned that fight for T1 it looks so disastrous the second Faker
22:02
basically got caught and died instantly T1 won't be able to find an objective for this and they picked up the dragon
22:07
bases coming in next objective will be the herald we'll see if we find another 5v5 one of the stories that has always
22:13
followed Faker throughout his incredibly long and accomplished career is how teams will focus him and it'll absorb
22:19
the pressure he's been focused a lot this game and fnatic weren't stopping in this fight he certainly has so this
22:25
bubble from Haley seals this deal because the poppy ultimate is if that hit humanoid maybe he could live and get out so humor goes for us now watch sales
22:31
here pops the E and then manages to get a lot of damage onto window then dashes through humanoid knocks him up gets the
22:36
old and takes down the mid laner turns into a four before it's on upset but it takes so long to get Zeus down but by the time he does Wonder also falls the
22:44
3v3 is winning for T1 with the Yumi offset being low wrestler being low it's just a case of get the hell out of there
22:49
upsets cleanse that is twice this game now that it has saved him from an otherwise Grizzly fate so getting a lot
22:56
of value out of that Summoner spell especially against the sejuani but now let's take a look at how much damage
23:02
actually got done you can see it's the 80 carries topping the charts for both sides and those tank junglers leading
23:08
the way right behind them they really are so this is a bit of a precarious situation here so phonics on the herald but they're losing their mid tier one
23:13
hila sang an upsetter spit t1's gonna engage on this three men Faker comes out with the stolen maokai ulti now the real
23:19
Mao coyote comes back poppy disengage they want to separate T1 sayus is going to be focused first he had to get away
23:25
but now humanoids in the back he's looking for owner and Faker humanoid is caught you can focus him again and again
23:33
and again and again and again and again and again but Faker finds his way the shuriken into death they're a wrestler
23:40
hit a crucial two-man knock with that Poppy ultimate and humanoid decided to follow through with his E I believe
23:46
fnatic get the herald they lose humanoid and they lose their Tower second items coming in here for T1 gold lead has
23:53
stayed pretty consistent around two to two and a half thousand gold these teams going very back and forth Faker finding
23:59
a kill there here's another look so Faker takes them alcohol and they
24:04
collapse from mid watch this knock from Resort I think as he knocks humanoid hits his e on to Faker so humanoid says
24:10
hang on a second maybe I can kill Faker here with the shuriken decides to take it despite the fight basically being one
24:17
jumps on top of the Silas owner notices and now he's in a 2b1 gets stunned up in his W and Khan's R2 out in time by the
24:24
time he does he falls nicely done there from T1 overconfident from humanoid in
24:30
his ability to take out that enemy mid lane and now T1 commanding still about a
24:36
two and a half thousand gold lead they're gonna look for the Top Lane tier one turret gumiyushi he's got his Yumi
24:42
locked and loaded the ignite on to wonder that tree is going down kumayushi
24:49
picks it up but fnatica looking to trade back racing a Herald for turrets often
24:54
doesn't work owner jumps over Seuss follows up Hilly's trying to get away t1's in hot two owners from the first
25:01
kill the herald dies to the turret Razor's gonna be next upset tries to provide covering fire but humanoids made
25:08
his way in yeah is ready to catch the pass humanoid
25:14
again trying to get away a double kill back from the faker humanoid running running running the only man left
25:22
standing in fnatic colors T1 collapse so beautifully onto fnatics push there from
25:28
topside with the TP from Faker huge step up by the top Jungle of T1 to shut down
25:34
hillisang to shut down the volcano fnatic and now they're going to get themselves a baron as well four kills in
25:39
an ash D1 just blew open the game absolutely incredible sequence of events watch this again Zeus on the side owner
25:47
on the opposite side oath lands onto hilly Zeus pops the authors well to land onto hilly two the TP coming in from
25:52
Baker is just all about buying time the three-man top side just running fnatic down they have to split razor gets
25:59
caught after hilly and then humanoid comes from that from the side here but it's Faker steel popular then knocks him
26:04
out here humanoid actually uses the E just one second before the E2 he gets knocked back and he gets knocked into
26:10
gumayushi Faker takes down upset and then T1 turn towards the baron
26:15
this game went from very close but T1 favored to fnatic now having to fight
26:21
for their lives this is not what they needed here at just 22 minutes into the
26:27
game remember in their last game it was a similar early Baron against them they could not recover
26:34
oh my God ready to win I call it the protagonist and I meant it 1v3 and he
26:40
already got the first kill now he might find a second Wonder wants to get away but sales will barely fail to kill him
26:47
gods are bleeding here Zeus almost gets the 1v4 if he got that first kill with a Triumph I think he could have turned it
26:53
with the lethal Tempo Stacks he does fall T1 get this box here too they managed to get the baron buff off of the
26:59
Jonas that helps in the push but it doesn't stop gomuchi and carrier in their tracks to get their Tower they
27:05
might move towards mid here Sonic don't have enough wave clear to stop this push humanoid's up in eight but he doesn't have TP he just used it towards the top
27:11
side so this Baron letting them a couple of objectives they got says but it took so many men in so many resources T1
27:18
punches back harder they'll secure the tier two in bottom secure the tier two in mid Baker just gets his recall
27:25
interrupted but fnatic no they can't do any more than that Baker just getting interrupted again ever Frost's gonna
27:31
slow him down he can walk this one off no problem you think eventually roswork wants to
27:38
delay razor is being the most obnoxious po",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRsG3HwOQDE
blue,EDG,FLANDRE,JIEJIE,SCOUT,VIPER,MEIKO,red,T1,ZEUS,ONER,FAKER,GUMAYUSI,KERIA,T1,"0:00
Lee but with only one band left either the southern Graves or the maokai graves
0:05
or maokai get through one of one of the two what's the choice here for T1 [Music]
0:10
as well with the melee soul laner is pretty strong and you're in a position where you can
0:15
choose to ban one leave the others up and available or ban nothing leave the pool wide open instead opting to ban the
0:22
Fiora respect to flandra again not a champion I expected to see from play busted it out twice today already
0:28
are they willing to do Carrie jungle every jungler has been googly eyes over
0:33
Graves here since the Buffs such a Powerhouse oh wow
0:39
I think this is why T1 elected to leave both maokai and said 20 up so that okay you get the sejuani we can get the you
0:46
know Graves plus sejuani back on the other side play it into the maokai front line
0:51
see what the option is going to be here now remember last time these teams played it was it
0:57
was Viper who got his hands on the cliff the expectation was that EDG Botley would run away with it maguma 5-0 and 12
1:03
the last time they met this time around who am I putting into the test just wants to show that he's better across the board both on the scaling and on the
1:09
early game Champions we'll get the callista for himself now it feels pretty mandatory that they take at least one of the remaining power
1:16
picks but perhaps they've got something else up their sleeve on the side of T1 yeah just trade it give the maokai get
1:22
sejuani as consolation they've been very very very happy with this champ
1:28
s per flexing it no problem now EDG gets a debate they can obviously
1:33
match A.D see if there are any other Champions they want to bring the board we've got Flex picks on either side and this is
1:38
wani and the maokai so a bit of uncertainty for both teams being sewed as we get ready for the second man phase
1:45
Zeus hasn't played a top since their since their games versus sandbox a while ago as well but it definitely could
1:51
still be Flex here and they're gonna go with the ofelios into the kalista this has been one of the popular figs see if they grab
1:58
uh the Renata as well you're already expecting that engage charging right at you or the safety of mako's Thresh
2:07
today three for three may go back on the thresh let's see that play and it's so
2:13
guaranteed with the maokai w setups and the thing is you highlighted already we've already seen this exact play from
2:19
the side of EDG where you just go mid with these two Champions and there is nothing you can do against a point-click cc of maokai into the follow-up but I
2:26
also just love seeing make on Playmakers the second Yumi is off the board and we get to see playmaker on player playmaker
2:33
Emily talked about on the desk carrier and Mako two of the best playmaking supports in the world no doubt in my mind now get to see them both Unleashed
2:39
on the rift as mid lane being targeted Faker opting to grab the Victor himself and now trim away some of the other
2:45
champions in the mid lane pool yeah Whittle down on some of these assassin picks here four Scout
2:51
is akali today was really clean instant band there meanwhile for EDG gotta look
2:57
at this support role the pairings with Calista what can we take off the board we take out the Renata
3:04
we were able to pick up the thresh ourselves what else do they want to opt for are
3:09
they concerned about the Nautilus obviously we're able to outplay fnatic but still a conventional counter pick and certainly stronger when empowered by
3:16
a callista viego now also going to hit the bench makes sense as the maokai remains a flex
3:23
Kobe I don't know about you but I'm feeling the pressure man I feel like my strong step one crazy pick could change he's tired if you've been either
3:30
lunatalus then then they could just go uh more engaged like Leona or something like that too
3:36
would be the go-to oh there's so worried about the pike carry a pike I mean it is
3:42
scary certainly shakes the game up oh please carry out one of the deepest Champion pools for supports
3:48
and he's playing with the hearts of the viewers at home as well as the audience here in New York Nautilus is the conventional Choice the
3:54
point-and-click is just so good versus that affilios but The Bard
4:01
Soraka the Soraka comes back very aggressive harassment in the early
4:07
stages here so good against thresh too because when you sell through yourself going for a death sentence boom Soraka
4:13
Nails you with both spells and difficult two now Braves finally if EG lock in
4:19
this Graves their composition excellent at fighting front to back but they don't really have a backline diver without a flank to get on top of the Soraka and
4:25
that's going to make this tanky front line in the form is running so much better but you want a diver there it is lissandra Graves Duo the kill pressure
4:32
onto Faker in this game will be immense some of the best EDG games have been
4:37
when they have these enabling mid lane Champions roaming around creating plays lissandra huge huge possibilities here
4:45
for scout if he can get out of Lane versus Faker and even setting up towards mid lane you think about Top Lane
4:52
roaming down maokai W roots with lissandra Cc or thresh roams around the map and they pick up Zales with the with
4:59
the Gangplank here for the ultimate towards bottom side they really have an aggressive bottom side now Gangplank ultimate plus the callista Soraka T1
5:07
could focus on trying to stack some Drakes down there open up some early cooldowns and I really love this because
5:12
you've built a composition and you're against EG who has to fight into you but GP and Victor are two Champions who are
5:18
hard to fight into Calista of course traditionally outscaled by a lot of these options GP that's not the case one incredible Barrel one good victral did
5:24
we go late enough in the game more than enough to turn the tides in their favor opposite side for EDG I'm looking at lissandra I'm looking at the setup
5:30
gangplic also really good versus lissandra too so see if I really do like
5:36
the the T1 side of it on this red side draft we'll see though EDG have a lot of
5:42
play-making ability maokai lissandra threat T1 versus EDG to end the group
5:50
just think about it this could this could easily be a world Final in any year it's been an MSI final
5:57
30 seconds and again the crowd hungry for Action here and you can't blame them
6:04
we might get a bit of Silence might be able to quiet on the first few levels at least in the game oh and we've got the
6:09
control Ward start here for JJ again control Ward start for the graves
6:15
see Faker First Strike no cleanse level six comes around the gank the setup the
6:21
path is clear for the side of EDG if they want to make those plays happen as you highlighted earlier Zeus with the oranges so easy
6:27
for him to mitigate a lot of that dive throughout a lot of that gank threat
6:33
and I think the bot Lane naturally is kind of where I look towards as explosive as the solar Lanes have been I
6:38
feel like the GP versus the maokai it's not going to be our source of action mid lane level six but we know how important the early levels are
6:44
carrion Goomba stepping forward hope not gonna connect onto Mako has taken death sentence level one yep
6:55
checking in I mean it's slow it's quiet a little bit of tension owner it's gonna get a bit of an early leash which does
7:02
mean that flandra gets first access to the wave on the top side bot side of neither team opted to go for the leash here
7:08
not surprised to see JJ a play away from the bot Lane on the first clear as he could try to make a play in the mid lane or Top Lane with the setup CC present
7:18
credit the Viper for stepping forward level two starts to get a little bit harder as this rock has more harass tools and a huge part of the early push
7:25
on this Lane goes with hitting those Soraka cues pretty good movement so far from the EDG Duo
7:30
dodging most of them but the early push of course still Acquired gumushi and Cary are gonna slowly move it in sejuani
7:36
moving down two with a red Raptor uh clear into blue quadrant they have the
7:42
pre-existing Ward over bottom Scuttle crab push already acquired so T1 securing
7:48
complete control of the bottom side of the map and it's little things Faker getting the early push in the mid lane
7:54
laying down that Vision keeping an eye on where the graves will be helping track some of the early kill pressure that is present on the side of this EG
8:00
EDG composition T1 sustaining pressure on the bottom side they could build a big wave and
8:06
look for a dive if they call owner over they could they could definitely burn
8:11
some cooldowns at the very least reverse Mako Viper yeah big old wave stacked up call over jungle Here Comes play the
8:18
game good heads up board they at least are gonna know that it's coming make up the play the death sentence press trade
8:24
maybe room now play zone he left his own krugs up so you expect JJ to also path up there take top crab look for his Krug
8:31
steel as well big thing here is T1 just gonna walk up out of the tower hit the plates poke and
8:37
harass because Mako and Viper cannot step forward as long as they're not certain where owner is they spot him now they know that he's taking the krugs but
8:43
the pressure on the bot side is already netted in a jungle Advantage for owner JJ now gonna try to respond on the top
8:49
side and steal away krugs from the opposition yep he knows so Johnny easily back into the river pick up Scuttle crab
8:56
go collect Raptors before you get your recall off and they should end up even
9:03
say it was okay with having the graves up there
9:08
and I'm just waiting see where these junglers go the stage of the game pretty calm pretty
9:14
collected from both sides Top Lane actually pushing a little bit for Zeus here so could get a little dicey with
9:19
Graves behind him he's got his wave in front off the oranges locked up immediately using the oranges JJ on the way up big slow coming in from the smoke
9:25
screen locking that one needs to walk away second half of the queue not gonna connect that's big Zeus walks out alive
9:31
doesn't burn any sums yeah a bunch of damage on those minions too so minions taking some Splash there he doesn't have
9:37
to worry about anything getting Frozen on the other side the map gets his recall off Zeus holds his Flash doesn't panic
9:47
no credit to him of course small goal lead for flounder for now is the wave this is just a little bit from Zeus TP
9:53
as well Advantage but you imagine maokai will be forced to come back to Lane Faker just trying to cancel the back here threatening Scout good hook
10:00
but no real follow-up there on the bottom side carrying she's so hard to bully out of Lane they have so much
10:05
sustain tell the tension here in the crowd to
10:10
top the group as soon as one skill lands teetering on an edge
10:18
of course when you don't know where the junglers are that is the kind of pressure that you're under a single piece of CC hits and there is the
10:23
follow-up fall down very quickly and again small advantages for either side could mean a lot zooming
10:29
forward five minutes in Harold's still three minutes out cft1 can use this opportunity getting uh
10:36
some canceled recalls here for Viper and Mako they're very low they have no more sustain left no more potions for Viper
10:41
50 Health there on the uh on the avellios and the way of getting pushed in once again it's an early move 41 they
10:49
they decide not to recall and go for the plate money One auto there getting it dangerously
10:56
close where you can see the longer they keep this Viper in this Lane without backing the bigger the Cs sleep feels like it's
11:02
going to get you highlighted already running out of Mana running out of Health
11:07
finally these Mako will get it back you've got JJ in the area covering making sure that the no dive can come
11:13
through I wonder if Mako goes mid with his recall then boots purchase for him could try and get some mid uh Vision set
11:19
up you are now hitting level six on the mid laners this six minute Mark is where you can have really big mid lane plays
11:26
lissandra with the ultimate but they're not even going to clear out
11:31
one of these gang pass control Ward exists around mid to the top side and we have an owner move towards top
11:37
side while JJ moves towards bottom coming down Mako is he gonna commit the flash slow already coming out Goomba
11:43
just forced to flash because he's not certain he can't see where the hook is going to come from so just flashes early in response exactly the smoke screen
11:49
such good gank setup just itself so very efficient move there for JJ
11:55
clears out the control ward in the river as well trying to establish control here for the route to gank through mid and
12:01
bottom and you can see immediately how far back Faker is playing because he knows now that six is here now that he doesn't have a cleanser opted not to
12:07
take a cleanse the pressure is on they're still going to come into it anyway flashing out but they go there with the hook the lantern the follow-up
12:12
it is textbook Focus around mid lane picker gonna try to walk it off but the ignite is there yeah a false sense of
12:18
confidence you see the jungler walk across your whole Lane JJ plays his part
12:24
perfectly look you don't have to worry about a gank you know I cleared the ward it's free he goes up to the top side but
12:30
he forgot about Mako Mako thresh all day today three for three in games he does
12:38
not miss Scout sets it up the flash play with Cassandra now they're roaming towards the top side too this treasure
12:43
could Cascade not done yet flandra low but it might not matter all coming out from the GP say it was caught off to the
12:48
side Scott ready to go over the wall locking him down David splashing out safety getting away from The Ring of frost that's gonna be big because owner's on the way up JJ has to be
12:54
careful not to overextend plunder so incredibly low excellent response from the side of T1 to get the flash from the
13:00
GP but they will not take his life that play is why clearing out this Vision between mid and Bot is so
13:07
critical that gank pathway both for jungler but also for support
13:12
Mako thresh making it happen again there four e d g and the first split money
13:18
goes right onto Scout two stacks onto the dark seal so Faker teleport had already been used he walks back very
13:24
quickly though gets a turret plate in answer for the attempt at Zeus's life yeah these early item buys especially if
13:31
Scout is going to offer the ever Frost are just so incredibly critical for team fighting offering more utility more
13:36
burst damage for lissandra as well making the resets easier is if you're taking the bad end of a trade there boom
13:42
and Kerry is still playing very far forward but XP advantage in favor of EDG for now
13:49
they re-establish control Ward presence in the river here for T1 immediately owner goes in for the red
13:56
buff contest leeching it himself said 20 doesn't do it very quickly but JJ will
14:02
stop at Raptors so that was going to give him enough time he's got Smite no problem it is secure level six sejuani
14:08
fully operational and you can tell how close this game is and how much it means to both teams
14:14
because neither side is risking overly aggressive moves to try to force Drake recall timers are being used for buys
14:20
for landing advantages either side able to match a significant enough lead that they're able to take one of these big
14:25
objectives across the map quite yet and you can see there Scout he then takes the couple seconds from mid lane
14:33
push out then move into the river clears that control Ward immediately as soon as JJ says hey he took my Reds he must have
14:39
put it down another control Ward go clear that thing out that is our play our path to play making her Scout though
14:46
hi stealth spotted him to buy time with it not too
14:51
threatening from a damage perspective but they will not over commit he's looking juicy though owner wants it
14:58
waiting hoping that he burns the e owner can't afford to miss the rock on
15:04
the way up they're gonna commit to the play Scout along goes buys himself a brief moment the gravity Fields already there the silence silent from the Soraka
15:11
area coming in I'm patience pays off but it's right at the rift Herald EG gonna start it out
15:17
regardless of scout going down and T1 are just going to roam everybody to the bottom side look at the turret plates
15:22
already being mined by gumayushi they kept Guma on bottom side EDG make the
15:28
call full rotation up and it's so critical the T1 are able to
15:33
grab not only plates in the bottling but plates in the mid lane because if it's just the herald the local gold pushing that trade very much in favor of adg but
15:39
Viper perfect guns to take a tower as I say that he swaps away can just drop the herald on the top side but T1 fighting
15:46
fire with fire responding with the play of their own 1K gold lead for now GP alt just to clear the wave the dive coming through on azaleos no way he makes it
15:52
out of this one Soraka heal will not be a knife Viper flashing out to safety though and carrier here to stop the push
15:58
from amounting to anything else sorako by herself not too scary though
16:03
Faker teleport is not even quite up yet so Faker could not even teleport the tower a couple more seconds on it maybe
16:09
when the cooldown comes up Harold can the herald charge before the teleport cooldown is up I think they're
16:16
gonna blow it up yeah trying to get it down that thing is gone two and a half plates gonna shred through it
16:22
EDG grabbing First Tower of the game now finding themselves the gold lead good heads up use of the herald Scout already
16:28
covering the bottom side to stop Guma for pushing for anything else oh one more one pistol shot
16:36
[Applause] doesn't mean much yet but might mean an extra easy 600 gold later in the game
16:43
Shelly's a hard worker gonna see that job done all the way under the secondary turret
16:48
definitely could mean something later on but not extreme slip pushing on the side of EDG of course they're looking for the
16:55
quick push and roam strategy try and make use of that crowd control setup Baker meanwhile moving down to
17:01
find Scott again Scott now has flash though in addition to his also okay removing to so much confidence because he has looteds massive item Advantage
17:07
you can just Zone scout out of this Lane force them out by trading aggressively and as long as there's not a jungler in the area heavily favored for him
17:18
it's just gonna back off there as Mako tries to regain control the bottom side of course important to note the graves obviously packs a punch in terms of
17:23
damage but umbral glaive just such an overall powerful item when it comes to these fights over Vision yeah especially
17:29
when you always combine it with the zombie Ward as a jungler it just proliferates the vision across the map
17:36
and he's going bottom side looking for Baker Scott with a set of man looking to lock him up gravity field can lock down JJ for a brief moment Scott now forced
17:42
to back away should you know on the chase That's The Challenge fight laid down one two shots coming in from the shotgun owner not gonna the oldest big
17:48
Virginia oh the movement from Baker but no one
17:53
bullet will fade away with the lantern from Mako it is beautiful to watch oh
18:00
Baker the hubris there he wanted the money but JJ he moves right in front of
18:05
the sejuani owner could not block the shots he gets the kill and gets out on
18:11
mako's Lantern this thresh is such an enabler
18:16
and that is an absolute moment where the tiniest mechanical differences matter
18:21
the Box laid down the lantern there the Viper not quite close enough to follow up
18:27
movement carrier saying focused but the gold still so close 400 difference between
18:33
these two teams there's a drake for the side of T1 but there's a tower for EDG oh my goodness all right I'm pretty sure
18:39
JJ misses the Q damage too so yeah Scout it gets flashes with the old JJ doesn't
18:45
get the Q damage or the r damage he's also gonna get juked on the r but as long as he eased the stud Baker comes
18:52
back in as it just moves acrossey gets the auto there you gotta have a body blocker
19:00
is that this moment he knew he made a mistake but then the Mako Lantern there as well
19:07
and the thing I love about that is even in a serious game even when the stakes are high both make uh Faker grinning JJ
19:13
grinning they both know what happened there you've just gotta respect I miss the queue you missed the r but you hit
19:19
the eye you gotta play it Flawless that's the pressure when the game comes through
19:26
Pfeiffer and Mako reestablishing control of the mid lane only gonna get harder for Thunder to sit Lane up against Zeus
19:33
the Triforce already completed it looks like collector on the way obviously very powerful with the GP all
19:41
right this game is delivered thus far it has been exactly what we wanted it is no longer one team out drafting or styling
19:49
on the other it is neck and neck it is Toe to Toe fist fight across every single Lane
19:54
and it's gonna be very interesting to watch he's in the barrel s the cats come out
20:04
oh my goodness he's full of Health two finger on the other side though again JJ
20:09
back for round two owners waiting for him KJ now we're gonna be in trouble only two stacks though the entire team now
20:15
backing off because they know they don't need to fight they don't need to force for anything else already on the top side Zeus has done so much to build an
20:20
individual Advantage 40 CS lead taking a tower the GP is massive yeah Trinity
20:26
force and serrated Dirk Spike here while flange is still working on Mythic
20:31
he made the stop-off to get the tier for the Mana and zarius finishes collector
20:37
at 15 minutes Trinity Force collector done here for Zeus after that level 11 as well rank two ultimate next time
20:47
honestly this is so quick oh so flying JW plays a little late he still took the barrel damage
20:53
he was trying to dodge the barrel damage with the w but it's a little late there is 80's just pops him
20:59
the cats just give him a warm hug on the way out he's having a great time getting everything he wants in the exchange and
21:04
T1 Now setting up around the objective and remember Jose is this far ahead with Faker at level 11. EDG fighting into
21:11
this is so hard but scouted on the side maybe he gets on the gun they're moving into a choke this could be big for those harder for the silence
21:17
no turn and picks and bears there are no buttons for scout to push it's too easy
21:24
for Carrier puts the silence field right down on that claw but a scout takes it
21:29
and instantly blown up and he couldn't help it five members there would have been a five-member snare but carrion
21:37
knows it's the best option another lamp oh man take this away the silences are too
21:44
clean from carry a T1 pulling ahead 2K gold lead sites set on
21:49
that mid lane tier one carrier with the bar trumpet as well he
21:54
just says no EDG two Wards down on that Lantern silence field again both EDG
22:02
carries both EDG carries countered instantly by carrier
22:08
so also rushed the McHale's to get every member any member of T1 who gets out he
22:15
can counter there as well all T1 already has built all the answers
22:21
the silence field was down so early too no reason for scout to take that no
22:26
reason at all for him to take that and maybe doesn't quite see the animation at the moment there are so many champions
22:32
there but here there's nothing you can do not only do they drop the silence not only do they
22:37
get the snare they drop two Wards right on top of that who worked in a big old poro Rider
22:45
looking like the champ of the day certainly is my goodness though this
22:51
this EtG comp it relies so mid so much on picking people off on Sidelines here
22:56
the maokai lissandra thresh that we went over but T1 not only do they have the
23:01
gangplank they also now have the McHale's to get anyone else out a Soraka heal as well
23:08
for anyone who gets picked they have so many answers built to the engage of EDG and I just I feel like the CDG
23:15
composition is so often functions like a shotgun you got one shot you gotta hit it scout needs these multi-man Ultimate Ninja needs these multi-man ultimates
23:21
but the Soraka is just a cork in the tip of that shotgun it is not going well
23:27
snare gonna hit three though that's big that could potentially be the start of the fight that they need Faker trying to Zone the rest of the team away but Scott's already on the back line he's
23:32
managed to lock down one maybe this is the follow Viper on the backside not able to get in though that's gonna be key two and a half seconds from the
23:37
zanyas [Applause] it's a pirate with a gun versus all of
23:43
Edie Gene he's making a work carrier the front line to rock up we went from dead even to Absolute Slaughter T1 taking
23:51
over the triple for Zeus dominating the fight curious and we are the boss of
23:58
group a T1 going to emphatically put their stamp on the day
24:05
it is a clean Ace Zayn is taking a heads here collected
24:12
collected collected man he's gonna have 10K at the end of
24:18
this tower that is a rich pirate before 20 minutes
24:23
oh four one and one Gangplank two thousand guys you talked about a loot pinata and we got one more on the wrist
24:30
sectioning on this team fight here Zeus this whole time this moves up and creates another front while the rest of
24:37
them go for the other side and are all focusing on faker Scout has to zoneos early the rest of
24:43
the group but zayas boom there's one collects him boom he's got another passive propped on viper already another
24:51
shot even as the lantern is coming out to save him they still connected on the exit and it's big because they have so
24:57
much Zone control if the initial combo does not work it does not take someone out immediately to get the lissandra reset you can see the smiles the Elation
25:05
on the faces of T1 and their staff because they know how easy it is it is for them to execute these fights how
25:11
well they have been playing to shut down all of edg's options 3K from the GP just
25:18
about 4K from Faker monster performances from these solo laners yeah Carrio with
25:23
that very quick McHale is onto Faker as soon as the maokai gauge went off and
25:28
Faker unleashes the full combo there storm up super early T1 absolutely smashing
25:38
and now it's a 6K gold lead Kobe 20 minutes so hard now for EDG to fight back again
25:44
if they can pick off single members they've still got a chance but you need to keep their eyes on Carrier really if they take that silence out of the equation maybe they can get a little bit
25:50
more done but if it's not to silence it's the gravity field of course there is a Herald in favor of adg they will
25:55
finally use it in the mid lane really trying to force this Exchange Australia's used lot and the back of
26:02
that hero a lot of Spears stacking up they won't be able to stop the charge but they can stop the follow-up push they use on the side again one big one
26:09
very angry pirate looking to make his way out of this group Faker already taking that one fly down to the side down Viper in no man's land five members
26:16
chasing him down he's got all the chakras in the world but he ain't got any teammates he's getting knocked down
26:23
and T1 setting their sights on the baron baker has always exited groups in first
26:28
place and today looks like it will be no different JJ gonna try and slip in here
26:33
for an objective Bounty off of this Dragon but the teleport comes through double teleport oh team one ready to
26:39
fight for everything carry off to the side the silence on the Scouts in the missing everything do they have enough damage the person down he's dominated
26:45
huge the Soraka keeping him healthy they can't kill him maybe just baby
26:50
he's surviving everything carrier the hero to stop to shut down the hero to
26:56
keep Zales alive
27:03
and there's nothing else we can say New York is saying it for us
27:08
close game first 15 minutes it takes one fight absolute confidence and execution from the side of T1 they are dominating
27:15
EDG so so clean started out owner with the
27:20
ultimate here over onto JJ they try and deal with the maokai old but look at this it's Zeus with the chaos storm
27:27
Faker and Deus run the entire team away from Viper the two T1 carries run them
27:33
off and then Viper's got no team left he's been run into the pit by himself T1 with Baron buff now oh fondra running no
27:41
Mako can't even speed him out to safety T1 they're just they're so far ahead now
27:47
the execution's already been fantastic but now the gold lead feels nice and surmountable felio's farming what he can
27:53
in the mid lane but he has to get out quickly the rest of T1 ready to collapse at a moment's notice he does not have the luxury of a thresh Lantern there he
27:59
has to retreat up back into his own jungle just to survive Viper fishing for a 1v1 against the support but he can't
28:05
finish the job and now while we know who can it's gonna be zayo scale Force out Viper just barely able to escape
28:13
my goodness these T1 carries the combination of Faker that go and Zeus
28:19
one of the most exciting players in the entire world right now just barely able to make it out you know
28:26
Zeus got a thunder Zales got a GP everyone's got their thing
28:31
oh the entire map in T1 control the whole thing is red there is there are
28:38
only specs of EDG blue to hide behind at this moment 13k gold on the GP goby it's
28:46
Infinity Edge on the way you're not supposed to see the pro game Kobe
28:52
incredible performance almost 4 items to one up here in the Top Lane match up yep
28:58
that is a brutal oh and to be fair to flandre I think you should probably stop
29:04
taking farm and give it to the carries but it's just so hard Viper just hitting two items Goomba already had three Faker
29:11
on the way to three has the Lich Bane too just for the extra close combat dueling doesn't need the death cap
29:17
EDG have to hold the line if they want first seed Hook Gonna connect on the fight or akumiyushi that could be the
29:23
start of something Faker getting zoned away but they burned all their cooldowns they have yet to find a kill the re-engage now coming in the Lockdown
29:29
from over the wall say who's still standing strong keep your eyes on the barrels where are they gonna go if they can find one kill maybe it'll be not Faker getting cut down Faker can he
29:35
stand strong the shutdown the reset from the lissandra one ghost not gonna be enough T1 too far ahead but they're
29:40
finding one at least they're slowing T1 down but still they push forward the hook going wide owner going in that's
29:45
his cue that is his signal the GP reigning hell from above
29:51
taking the kill soraka's op but not that op can't keep
29:56
sets alive under the tower there last one does take it down a little bit of Hope for EDG a little bit of a spark two
30:03
kills for themselves getting a shutdown there on to faker now is the time to Rally you hear the
30:10
fans trying to start it up looking for that comeback 10 000 gold
30:15
down three dragons down but a hope alive
30:22
they need it fuel for the fire
30:27
it takes time that's all you did you need that's the hope that they're buying themselves a few more minutes to farm to get stronger but despite the lead T1 mil
30:33
EDG still managed to make some things happen yeah they engage on both sides flandre flashes on Baker while",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBR0G5Gaty0
